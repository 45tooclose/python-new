Congrats on the ICO :)We, as investors are happy for the fact that the entire process went so smoothly. We have high hopes and share your vision for this project. However, we are concerned about the lack of volume considering this project who is now in post ICO stage. Lykke, EtherDelta and Idex are decentralised exchanges, but they do not fillup the role that they are suppose to be providing, and that is increased volume and easy access to new potential users/ speculators or investors. The listing on bigger exchanges is expensive proccess, but the history shows us, it is also efficient. It promotes the token to a status of a market demand and supply, gives access to new users and provides sufficient liquidity for it. Even the money itself invested into a bigger exchange returns itself shortly after the listing. Plus I would like to add that this is something that you as a team owe to us as an investors who trusted you to fullfill that role. We can take example of a similar project, like Modum..Modum now has around the 1+ milion volume on daily basis and has reached from around 15 mil of ICO value to a high od 200 milion in a 2 months. I dare to say it happened thx to Binance. It dropped since the high, but still it is way over it beginning stage and also has a great future . Just drawing the parralels with Valid, becouse they had similar start, and I dare to say, Valid does have bigger potential than it. :)
