Interview 2Today I was able to interview with a person who I feel is a good representation of potential lenders. I think it’s very important to understand this customer segment because without people willing to lend their money, there’s no reason for a lending platform. Almost everyone is willing to put their money in the bank, whether it be a checking account, savings account, or certificate of deposit. But not everyone would be willing to let that money be lent out to others, even though that happens regardless when their money is in the bank. I think this might be the hardest struggle to overcome while creating this app/ website.For this interview I had prepared better ahead of time and had a much longer list of questions to ask. Throughout the interview I discovered that she had not really thought about the fact that banks were using her money while it sat in her account. She actually didn’t seem too comfortable with the fact, even though she knows her money is insured. She told me that she was a customer at many different banks, which means she is aware of creating a diverse portfolio to eliminate risk. I think this is an important concept lenders will need to understand, to spread their money to multiple borrowers, so it will be less risky for them, as well as making the needs of borrowers easier to meet. It will be better for the company to have lenders willing to spread their money rather than stick with one borrower because we’d be able to fulfill / match more orders.Overall this interview was much more helpful and I discovered where I will need to work hard to make sure things go smoothly. The fact that she was uneasy with banks using her money while its in her account shows me that this could be a struggle. It’s natural to be afraid of risk, so it might be harder than I thought to get people to lend out their money.
