I’ve a number of issues with what I think is a well written but flawed assessment of a collection of systemic, financial and technological innovations.The most glaring, and frankly most pressing is your utter failure to distinguish between security tokens (I.e. the future for most of these instruments around token sales) and utility and/or protocol tokens — which have been Mis or overused as a mechanism by ill informed lawyers and/or aggressive entrepreneurs.Founders go to the fastest path to cash on their way to building companies. For many — token sales offer a unique accelerant and a mechanism for providing liquidity and transparency to a previously complex and illiquid process.Security tokens are the next stage of revolution begun by AngelList and the convertible note. They are smart, secure and backed by a financial interest in the business (equity, rev share, assets).Utility tokens are airlines miles. Or casino chips. You have to believe in the longevity of the casino, the strength of its relationships with other players in the ecosystem and an ability to continue to draw players, employees and audiences. A riskier bet for sure, but also one with a different set of measures and qualifications for success.As an early cofounder of internet 1.0 and 2.0 business (17+ in all) I can tell you the level of fraud and froth is no greater and probably less in this revolution than previous. I can also tell you the scale of this opportunity broadly dwarfs any transformative technology transition I’ve experienced.Happy to debate but let’s get fundamental fact sets agreed 1st.Cheers
