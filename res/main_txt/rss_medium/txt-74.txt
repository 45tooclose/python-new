The Product (CloudFish)A cloud-based platform that enables companies and individual users to secure their block chain and digital assets stored in the cloud using encryption-as-a-service. The unified platform uses machine learning algorithms to automate threat detection and control before it becomes a risk to the security of users’ assets.CERTIFIED TECHNOLOGYCloudFish’s SaaS server securely stores the encryption keys for digital assets like documents, files etc and the block chain asset keys like crypto currencies in a secured unified way accessible though a biometric-based authentication mechanism.Cloudfish is based on the industry-standard AES 256-bit encryption technology for encrypting digital assets. The product is registered with the United States Department of Commerce as a commercial encryption based product.The company plans to get its technology and platform audited by independent technology audit companies and make the audit reports and certifications accessible to its customers through the company’s web site.Dubbed “encryption-as-a-service”, CloudFish security suite lets users transparently encrypt their cloud-stored data by using a simple SaaS-based approach that does not require any technical knowledge or software installed at the user end.CloudFish’s Cloud Security Gateway (CSG) for enterprises uses machine learning and artificial intelligence based algorithms to automatically detect and control suspicious user activity, external intrusion, potential ransomware activity and high-risk data leaks (credit card information, social security numbers, PHI and corporate intellectual property) in the cloud server before it becomes a risk to the enterprise.KEY COMPETITORSCloud Security Gateway (CSG) BusinessBitglassImpervaCipherCloudSkyhigh NetworksCloudLock (acquired by Cisco)Blue Coat (acquired by Symantec)Content Encryption BusinessnCrypt CloudBoxcryptor“The cloud-based security market remains a viable one offering providers many opportunities for expansion. The strongest interest will be in encryption products from cloud security brokers, which are relatively easy to deploy and have options for on-premises encryption management.” -GartnerOUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGEStrong Affiliation with Research Institution: Research and development is a cornerstone to our offerings.
