ColossusXT Linux Wallet 1.0.3 Update GuideThis is a living document. The most current version can be found here.This guide will help you update your 1.0.0 Linux wallet to the latest wallet version 1.0.3. You can use this guide for any Linux ColossusXT wallet installation, including a local Linux install or a VPS system, for a normal Linux wallet or for a Linux masternode, and for Raspberry Pi Linux installations as well.Linux Installation RemindersAll Linux commands are CASE SENSITIVE. ALWAYS pay close attention to case.The ~ symbol is a shortcut to the current user’s home folder, which is /root for the root login, and /home/username for any other user’s login. It is not a random squiggly mark; it has a specific and important meaning.Just like on Windows and OSX, the ColossusXT application involves two directories: A programdirectory, which contains the program executables, and a wallet directory, which contains your wallet file, config files, and blockchain data. This guide assumes that your existing programdirectory is ~/colx-1.0.0/bin. If you installed to a different location or have a different version, substitute that path as needed. The wallet directory is generated automatically at~/.ColossusCoinXT, and should be the same on all systems.Let’s get started.Back Up Your WalletThe new wallet version uses your existing wallet files in their current location, and makes no changes to them, however, an update is a good time to back up your wallet. If you already have a known good backup, you can skip this step.The easiest way to back up your wallet.dat from a remote Linux / VPS system is via a secure FTP program such as WinSCP. Install WinSCP from the link provided, then connect using your IP address, login and password. Click “Yes” on the one-time warning to accept the server’s host key.Once connected, you will need to press [CTRL]+[ALT]+H to enable viewing hidden files. Navigate to your remote ColossusXT wallet directory ~/.ColossusCoinXT and drag the wallet.dat to your desired destination on your local file system.Stop Wallet ProcessUse the cd command to navigate to your ColossusXT program directory, and then stop the server daemon process:cd ~/colx-1.0.0/bin./colx-cli stopDelete Existing Program FoldersOnce the server is stopped, delete any existing ColossusXT program directories:cd ~rm -rf colx-1.0.0Download The 1.0.3 ColossusXT Wallet Program From Github:Use the wget command to download the 1.0.3 wallet archive directly to your ~/Downloads directory.NOTE: There are different wallet versions available for each system architecture. If you don’t know your architecture, use the arch command:Use only the command that matches your system architecture:x86_64wget -P ~/Downloads https://github.com/ColossusCoinXT/ColossusCoinXT/releases/download/v1.0.3/colx-1.0.3-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gzi686wget -P ~/Downloads https://github.com/ColossusCoinXT/ColossusCoinXT/releases/download/v1.0.3/colx-1.0.3-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gzARMwget -P ~/Downloads https://github.com/ColossusCoinXT/ColossusCoinXT/releases/download/v1.0.3/colx-1.0.3-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gzExtract The New Wallet Archive To Your Home FolderNow use the tar command to extract the archive to a new COLX folder located at /user/home/colx-1.0.3.
