Game Loot Network San Francisco SpotlightLast month, Game Loot Network stormed through the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. The gathering overflowed with the latest marvels of the industry. Interactive booths lured players aside with VR quests and the clamor of digital warfare. Heavyweights like Facebook and Amazon showcased their spectacle, and indie developers drew crowds with art-blazed graphics set upon handcrafted narratives.Afterwards, company execs held an exclusive happy-hour, cavorting with the industry’s finest to discuss the Game Loot Network platform. Meetings were held, hands were customarily shaken, and secret agreements struck to be announced later. In between business and mischief, a swashbuckling group of GLNers retired to the streets of San Francisco. There they sailed upon polluted seas to Alcatraz, feasted upon company expensed meals, and toured around like gaming hedons. They also made plans to do it all again in Dubai or Brazil or “somewhere with a beach and tequila.” Check out the adventure and join the ride on social-media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/gamelootnetwork/Twitter: https://twitter.com/gamelootnetwork/Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/GameLootNetwork/
