CargoX, the little gem no one talks abouthttp://www.cargox.ioOur investment group has been accumulating on CargoX (CXO) for a while now. CargoX is among our top picks for 2018, An ICO with a hard cap of 7M USD worth of ETH that sold out in 10min.Although a few other projects are being developed in the same area (logistics), CargoX is focusing exclusively on Bill Of Lading (BOL). It’s such a simple concept that its genius, using BoL as a Blockchain service will bring to logistics worldwide a much faster, reliable and economically efficient way of transacting this document.With a vastly experienced team in the field of logistics, a working product within Q2 of 2018, and a Market cap of 5M by the time of writing, we expect nothing but big gains from this little gem.Support us by following usInsiderThe exclusive Insider Crypto Group has expanded and now offers a public and VIP telegram channel.
