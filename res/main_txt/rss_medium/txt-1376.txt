Notes from Underscore.vc Blockchain Conference Mar 22, 2018300 people attended this excellent event (agenda here). Kudos to Underscore.vc on a very good event! My summary notes below.NotesBlockchain ScalabilityObviously a massive problem. Ethereum 10tx/sec vs Visa 80K/txNotable commentthe current state is horrific. As volume increases, things get worse (more latency, fees go up). “Scalability is moving in the opposite direction”Each marginal customer in Visa cost LESS, but with blockchain each marginal customers cost MOREOverall, technical attendees believe the scalability problem would be solved (likely with feature tradeoffs) but no agreement on how quickly.ICO / Token offerings80% of ICO last year had negative returnsEarliest ones (Bitcoin, ETH) had best returns with declining returns for newer onesLess mega $ ICO are expected, more around $20–30MConflict arising between ICO and VC fiduciary responsibilitiesUS companies will domicile in Cayman and other countries to get around emerging US regulatory tighteningWilmerHale partner (and ex-SEC staffer) on ICO clampdownSEC is trying to tap down ICO very aggressively. SEC was caught off guard last year by the explosion of ICO and working to get it cleaned up. Getting this cleaned up and tapped down is the SEC’s #1 priorityThere clearly be a flurry of SEC enforcement actionsToken classification: security vs utilityLots of discussion of Security vs Utility token classification. The general feeling is that utility token must have immediate use and demonstration of value when ICO raised. A “Chucky Cheese” token that can be used immediately after issuance (few startups are doing this. hard for some applications) and for which it is hard to see how the problem could be solved without using a utility tokenSmart Contract (SC) developmentLots of challenges. “Do we really need SC for these proposed applications?”SC are immutable. How do you handle changes or amendments?All the data is public. How do you handle private data?“It is impossible to code on Ethereum” “Why do we need to learn another language for SC?SC is painful today but less painful than 3 months ago and trend line is improving but too slowSevere lack of tools for SC; open source and big sw companies need to improveEthereum is the leading environment for SC but other platforms have better developer experienceUse cases and non-crypto apps with network usageCryptoKitties using 15% of Ethereum’s network remains stunning.A few promising companies presented (FirstBlood — gaming (1000 sessions per day), possibly Bloom for credit score)[Paul view: But many teams and ideas seem focused on ICO fundraising and technical challenges, and not details of customer willingness to use/pay and 10x uniqueness versus non-blockchain apps]
