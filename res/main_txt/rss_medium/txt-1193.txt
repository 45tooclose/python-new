It fits the usage for Cryptips very well as its a low fee, fast coin.Vertcoin support is added by entering your Vertcoin master public key into the profile settings just like you do with BTC, LTC & GRS. This doesn’t give access to your funds. It just allows the system to generate addresses to your wallet.Find out more about Vertcoin http://www.vertcoin.orgJoin the Cryptalk Discord if you have any questions.https://discord.gg/UBBjMa8
