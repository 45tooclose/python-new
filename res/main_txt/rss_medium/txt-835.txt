In the beginning the programmers who are used to computers shared an idea about free things, like free softwares, computers and operational systems like LINUX. In addiction some people had seen the oportunity to earn a lot of money with centralized products.The idea of peer to peer (based on the idea that a computer that connects to a network should be capable of sharing its resources with any other computer) wasn’t nothing new but was rethink with the bitcoin invention, who gave another way to not live a life depending on huge servers from being attacked by hackers or some CEO didn’t selling your data to anothers companys.In blockchain we have the information and you eliminate everything that centralize something, with transparency we will never have corruption because no one is receiving our data storing it to some big data, you or anyone can track where the data is going to.One example is on online music while spotify have doubtful ways of payment for their subscribed musicians for each music played.
