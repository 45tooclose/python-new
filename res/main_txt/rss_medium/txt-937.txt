Sharding is coming according to Ethereum FounderTechStartups.comEthereum mastermind Vitalik Buterin released a new proof of concept that demonstrates how the sharding scalability solution can be “bolted on” to the Ethereum main chain.This is good news for the smart contract world computer Ethereum, since scalability is a major issue.The demonstration follows a current “minimum sharding protocol” initiative by the Ethereum cofounder that plans to radically improve the trade throughput and scalability of their Ethereum blockchain. In times when Crypto appears to be rebounding in April, there’s light at the end of the tunnel for dApp platforms and the future of decentralization.What is Sharding?The number of Ethereum transactions has dramatically increased over the last several years, which has caused transaction fees to rise accordingly.The concept of sharding involves splitting the Ethereum blockchain into potentially myriad smaller sections that are able to process transactions in a parallel manner, thereby speeding up transaction throughput and capacity.A recently available upgrade printed by Buterin about the 29th of April summarizes cross-linking for a remedy to match the execution of the minimum sharding specification, speeding up shard collation.In essence, Sharding is a solution that optimizes the process of verifying transactions and smart contracts by splitting the blockchain network into partitions called shards. (CNN)A “Minimal Sharding Protocol”According to Cryptoslate, the integration of the sharding scaling solution appears to have kicked into high gear over the last month.
