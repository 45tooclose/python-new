Pay attention to scams in crypto spaceNowadays, “sophisticated hackers”, in their endeavours, to get some new Bitcoins… do this type of “fishing”.This is one example of a simple phishing method that arrived in my inbox. Pretty “neat”. Even the security alerts of the “attempts” are scammed :) Did not even use this type of “Blochkchain” before ? but who knows?The “action” described in mail, never happened. I‘m pretty sure that some people “got hacked” with this method. If you happen to get mails like this one, pay attention to who’s the real sender, by simply checking the links and the main sender and also double check the raw mail source.Not necessary to say that your wallet WILL BE EMPTIED once YOU GIVE them the keys to the castle. I’ve seen something more sophisticated, in the sense that MITM attacks were performed while poisoning the DNS servers too...If you hold a good amount of coins I recommend you to stack them into a cold wallet like Ledger Nano S or equivalent. Use what’s necessary for you on the short term with another wallet, keep the rest in the cold.Stay frosty crypto people!
