The chart suggests that the price has met resistance at 10,020$, conveniently enough that’s exactly where the 200MA line is, so we believe that Bitcoin is overbought right now, and a correction is eminent. Our Analysts have made an educated guess, and they believe that a correction to 100MA which translates to 9000$ is a healthy move.By looking at the RSI, we can see that it’s in the overbought territory, and it’s predictable to see it cool down in order to give BTC price some more room.
