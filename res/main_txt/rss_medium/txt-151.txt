Instead, you and we will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions.Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to you and us and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution.Each Party will notify the other Party in writing of any Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the Parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally.

The Rules for Expedited Arbitrations shall apply where the amount in dispute does not exceed US$100,000. Where the amount in dispute exceeds US$100,000 the Arbitration Rules shall apply. The Arbitral Tribunal shall be composed of a sole arbitrator where the amount in dispute exceeds US$100,000 but not US$1,000,000. Where the amount in dispute exceeds US$1,000,000, the Arbitral Tribunal shall be composed of three arbitrators. The amount in dispute includes the claims made in the Request for Arbitration and any counterclaims made in the Answer to the Request for Arbitration. The seat of arbitration shall be in Melbourne, Australia. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English. The arbitrator will have (i) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (ii) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms.

MiscellaneousSeverability.If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held unlawful, void or unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these Terms.The Entire Agreement.

Certain Risks Relating to Acquisition, Use, Holding, Sale or Transfer of KOIAs noted elsewhere in these Terms, the KOI are not being structured or sold as securities or any other form of investment product. Accordingly, none of the information presented in this Exhibit A is intended to form the basis for any investment decision, and no specific recommendations are intended. We expressly disclaim any and all responsibility for any direct or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from: (i) reliance on any information contained in this Exhibit A, (ii) any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such information or (iii) any action resulting from such information.By making a Contribution, participating in the Koios token sale, holding and using KOI, you expressly acknowledge and assume the following risks:Risk of Losing Access to KOI Due to Loss of Private Key(s), Custodial Error or Purchaser Error.A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of KOI stored in your digital wallet or vault. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet or vault storing KOI will result in loss of such KOI. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a digital wallet or vault service you use, may be able to misappropriate your KOI. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or vault you choose to receive and store KOI, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your KOI.Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol.Because KOI, smart contracts, and the System are based on the Ethereum protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum protocol may have a material adverse effect on KOI, smart contracts, the System and/or Services. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to KOI, the System and/or Services, including the utility of KOI for obtaining the Services, by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum protocol.Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses.Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with KOI, the System and/or Services in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing.Risk of Uninsured Losses.Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, KOI are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by us, to offer recourse to you.Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions.The regulatory status of KOI and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including KOI, the System and/or Services. Regulatory actions could negatively impact KOI, the System and/or Services in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that KOI are a regulated financial instrument or security that require registration and/or licensing. We may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.Risks Arising from Taxation.Purchasing KOI may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including the imposition of withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements. You should seek tax advice from your own tax counsel in connection with making a Contribution, holding, acquiring, selling or transferring KOI.Risk of Alternative Platforms.It is possible that alternative platforms could be established that utilize the same technology and protocol underlying the System and attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the Services. The System may compete with these alternative platforms, which could negatively impact the System, Services and KOI, including KOI’s utility for obtaining the Services.Risk of Insufficient Interest in the System or Distributed Applications.It is possible that the System will not be used by a large number of individuals, companies and other entities or that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of platforms such as Koios more generally. Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the development of the System and the potential utility of KOI, including its utility for obtaining the Services.Risks Arising from the Market in Which the System Operates.The Artificial Intelligence market and, accordingly, KOI, the System and Services, are subject to a variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations, including those with respect to personal identifiable information, data protection, privacy and security, competition, consumer protection, data security, and others.These laws and regulations, and the interpretation or application of these laws and regulations, could change and vary from country to country. In addition, new laws or regulations affecting KOI, the System and Services could be enacted, which could impact the utility of KOI, including KOI’s utility for obtaining the Services.Additionally, the System and Services and their users and customers are subject to or may be adversely affected by industry specific laws and regulations or licensing requirements. If any of these parties fails to comply with any of these licensing requirements or other applicable laws or regulations, or if such laws and regulations or licensing requirements become more stringent or are otherwise expanded, it could adversely impact KOI, the System and Services, including KOI’s utility for obtaining the Services.Risks Associated with the Development and Maintenance of the System.The System is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although we intend for KOI and the System to follow the specifications set forth in the Project Documentation, and will take commercially reasonable steps toward those ends, we may have to make changes to the specifications of KOI or the System for any number of legitimate reasons. This could create the risk that KOI or the System, as further developed and maintained, may not meet your expectations at the time of purchasing KOI. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop and maintain the System, it is still possible that the System will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the System and the potential utility of KOI, including its utility for obtaining the Services.Risk of Hard-Fork.The System will need to go through substantial development works as part of which it may become the subject of significant conceptual, technical and commercial changes before release. As part of the development, an upgrade to KOI may be required (hard-fork of KOI) and that, if you decide not to participate in such upgrade, you may no longer be able to use your KOI and any non-upgraded KOI may lose its functionality in full.Risk of Unfavorable Fluctuation of Currency Value:We intend to use the Contributions to fund the development of KOI, the System, the Services and various other operating expenses. The Contributions received will be denominated in ETH or other cryptographic currencies, and may be converted into other cryptographic and fiat currencies. If the value of ETH or other currencies fluctuates unfavorably during or after the contribution period, we may not be able to fund the development of, or may not be able to maintain, the System and/or the Services in the intended manner.Risk of Dissolution of the Company.It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, we may no longer be viable to operate and the Company may dissolve.Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights.Because KOI confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to the System or the Company, all decisions involving the System or the Company will be made by us at our sole discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue the System, to issue more KOI for use in the System, or to sell or liquidate the Company. These decisions could adversely affect the System and the utility of KOI that you hold, including KOI’s utility for obtaining the Services.Unanticipated Risks.Cryptographic tokens such as KOI are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks included in this Exhibit A, there are other risks associated with your Contribution, participation in the Koios token sale, acquisition, holding and use of KOI, including those that we cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in this Exhibit A.
