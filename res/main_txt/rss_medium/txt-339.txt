CoinField CEO Babak Bob Ras states; “We are fully aware which coins are the most desirable by Canadian crypto community and our team work around the clock to bring these new coins in Canada for the first time however in order to stay compliant with the regulations, before we list any additions to our expansive portfolio, we have to analyze and evaluate the coins to make sure the ones we are listing are “commodities” as we do not list any “securities” on our platform.”CoinField employs a very strict AML/KYC policy to fight money laundering activities through cryptocurrency. Company executives have said “Any and all attempts to hurt our traders and tarnish the perception of the revolutionary blockchain technology will be met with the full force of our cutting-edge security infrastructure.” To that end, CoinField is determined to actively and voluntarily file reports with regulatory and enforcement agencies to ensure a safe, legal, and worry-free trading experience for all its users.Security of both the platform and the traders’ assets is of utmost importance to the company, and CoinField has in place a plethora of features to ensure peace of mind for everyone involved with the platform.

Other security features such as Suspicious Activity Logger, DDoS Protection by Cloudflare® and Isolated Server Access compliment the aforementioned components, creating a hack-proof trading ecosystem.Judging by the company’s ambition to become the top cryptocurrency exchange in Canada, it is equally important for CoinField to provide stellar customer support as it is to guarantee security.
