Unmasking the true accuracy of CindicatorA recurring theme throughout my undergraduate business education stressed the notion that “there is no such thing as a free lunch”, or rather, that it is impossible to get something for nothing.While this old adage hailing from the early 20th century rings true across nearly all facets of life, it is especially relevant to discussions concerning financial markets. There is not one speculator on this Earth that can be said only to have made winning trades — and no investor that can claim to have avoided all financial risk prior to seeing positive returns. Success in markets always comes at a cost — Whether it be in the form of capital allocated toward an investment, time spent researching various projects, or many months (even years) of patience and trust in the fundamentals — nothing is free.Take for example the infamous case of BitConnect.Among financial professionals, it is known to be weary of “guaranteed profits” and those who claim an ability to provide them.The Bitconnect price has collapsed by more than 99.7% since December 29thNonetheless, this did not deter individuals from expecting “a free lunch”. Some may have escaped unscathed, but ultimately the price was paid. No matter how clearly fraudulent a project may be, there will always be those enticed by the allure of riches and a charlatan’s promise.
