The two sides agreed to compliment each other’s resources to build a credit system with the use of livestock collateralization and Big Data on the Blockchain to promote the application of inclusive finance on a global level.Sentinel Chain is a blockchain-based international marketplace for cross-border financial services and the world’s first platform to accept the use of livestock as collateral. Taking a unique approach to the last mile problem of financial inclusion, the Sentinel Chain model establishes livestock provenance through the creation of livestock insurance on blockchain. The registration of livestock provenance on blockchain provides the unbanked with a new opportunity: the real possibility of accepting livestock as ‘collateral’ for loans.“This partnership can provide Banyan Network access to a large untapped unbanked market with high demand on big data usage needs. This is an example of how SENC and BBN token model can complement effectively in creating high utility value for both networks.” — David Zhou, CEO of Banyan NetworkIn order to create a livestock insurance product, insurance providers need large amounts of time series data on the mortality rate of the assets — which is where the DVN could create much insight. If livestock insurance is provided, it would ease the use of livestock as collateral for Sentinel Chain.“By leveraging Banyan Network’s technology, our livestock insurance partner will be able to gain access to an integrated big data analytics platform that can be used to facilitate their design of livestock insurance products. At the same time, loan providers will be able to use the same technology to create high quality credit analysis for unbanked borrowers using our onchain data.” — Roy Lai, CEO of Sentinel ChainBanyan Network is a fusion of big data network based on blockchain technology called Data Fusion Value Chain Network (DVN). It is also the world’s first distributed ecosystem of data economies raised and built by team experts in the field of data analytics.Website: https://www.banyanbbt.org/Medium: https://medium.com/banyannetworkTwitter: https://twitter.com/banyan_networkReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/BanyanNetworkTelegram: https://t.me/BBNGlobalFans
