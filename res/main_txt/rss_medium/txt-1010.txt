How Charts Confuse People, and Why Investors Should Know Their TimeframeThis is a quick post.Most of you may already be aware of what you’re about to read. Some of you may find it interesting or new.What I am going to do is show you two charts. The first chart looks like this:I know a lot of people who see charts like this and think, “the move has already been made.” It looks daunting. Why would you buy up there when you could have bought down there. They may have a point. But they are missing a lot of information.I’m not sure what the name is for this kind of bias or heuristic. But it seems to be somewhere in-between an anchoring bias (relying too heavily on one piece of information) or an availability heuristic (recalling emotional memories or charged memories over everything else and forgetting about the normal instances).I find that a lot of people see big upward sloping charts, and think “parabolic” or a “crash is coming.” Maybe that’s because of Bitcoin or the Financial Crisis or the DotCom Bubble are all most engrained in their memories. It’s the first thing they think of when they see a chart — big slope upward, eventually leads to big slop downward.But the chart above is just a 4-hour chart of Apple during late 2010. When you zoom-out from that brief little period, the picture now looks like this:The lesson here isn’t a bullish or bearish lesson. You can swap in or out any chart in the world. You could find one where the chart eventually goes to zero. The lesson is something everyone gets wrong at least once. That lesson is losing sight of your timeframe, and easily persuaded your perception of charts is by past instances. It’s forgetting how moves that happen throughout a day are nearly impossible to spot when plotted over several years.You can’t be in the markets if you don’t know what timeframe you’re looking for. And you can’t be in markets if you don’t know how easy it is to get misperceived by one piece of information.
