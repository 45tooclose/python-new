MAINFRAME: THE WEB3 COMMUNICATIONS LAYER“Aliens or asteroids can’t stop this.” Mick Hagen, Founder of MainframeYouTubeShare your videos with friends, family, and the world.www.youtube.comABOUT THE MAINFRAME PROJECTRecently we all witnessed a major scandal with the exposure of personal data of the Facebook users to third parties. The impact from this particular breach affected almost 6 million users and it is a sign of a larger problem when it comes to protecting personal data on the Web.Accidentally (or not) Facebook got caught with their hands in the cookie jar, but who knows how many data breaches have gone under the radar so far, not to mention government monitoring and malicious agents posing additional threats.The privacy of personal data and the freedom of communication without censorship and surveillance are issues that have been negatively affecting everyone. All of this and much more has been recognized by a team of enthusiasts and visionaries who are creating not just another project but a movement! This movement’s name is the Mainframe project and its goal is to create a new layer of the internet where privacy and freedom are number one priorities.Mainframe is a communication platform that provides security and user sovereignty. It offers safe, untraceable, surveillance and censorship resistant communication combined with today’s best networking protocols and applications.The Mainframe journey started back in 2013 with an email application and continued growing into the project Spatch. By 2017 the project incorporated the blockchain technology and as a result brought to life a fully decentralized messaging app with dark routing called Onyx.To provide unparalleled security the Mainframe platform consists of various protocol layers:· Encryption (provides protocols for one-to one and one-to many encryption enabling data privacy),· Dark routing (prevents malicious actors to trace communication patterns between nodes),· Incentivization (keeps the network running smoothly and securely by using tokens),· Unhosted architecture (it is both distributed and decentralized meaning that the developers on the Mainframe platform are not obliged to provision or manage their own infrastructure)· Interoperability (software development kit that enables easy integration with a variety of popular languages, operating systems and devices and with various popular blockchains).Besides the Onyx messaging application that is built on the platform, the Mainframe team believes that the platform can support a wide variety of products and services from enterprises, consumer products and governments to social networking and fintech.
