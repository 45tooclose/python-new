When we began building Balanc3, we quickly realized we also needed institutional-grade data. We set out to develop our own blockchain scrapers and custom exchange-pricing APIs. Using primary data, we were able to meet the high expectations of our enterprise clients. Demand quickly grew for our robust data feeds, so we have decided to empower third-party applications with our technology.We are excited to announce that our exchange data, which determines the fair market value of hundreds of digital asset trading pairs, has successfully been integrated into MetaMask.MetaMask now displaying pricing information for ERC-20 tokensMetaMask’s 1.15 million users will now see robust pricing information across all of their ERC-20 tokens in their wallet.
