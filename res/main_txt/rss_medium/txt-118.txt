Did you Know Ethereum is actually more popular than Bitcoin?Bordering on being the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has enjoyed years of global interest and popularity but recent researches have discovered Ethereum to be stealing Bitcoin’s thunder in India.Cryptocurrencies have been known to generate more interest placed on Bitcoin. However, following the waves of regulations filed against the use of credit cards for cryptocurrency investments in many Western banks along with the banks in India, the interests in Bitcoin have been noted to wane in favor of Ethereum.Though Bitcoin and Ethereum are built on the same underlying foundation of blockchain technology, it should be noted that trying to put them together to tell their differences apart would be like putting a lion and a shark together and ask their differences in strengths be told.Ethereum, which offers dApps and smart contracts in place of digital coins and a transactions platform offered by Bitcoin, have been noted to top the charts of internet Indian provider, Jana, by holding a relative 34.4% share of the currency searches while Bitcoin’s searches tagged at a 29.9% share.Bitcoin’s popularity for the last few years in India had been traced to its decentralization. It had especially surged at a time when the Reserve Bank of India had placed an embargo on the circulation of high-valued bills in the country with trading volumes increasing on cryptocurrencies exchanges and Bitcoin trading at a 30% premium.With the shine momentarily off Bitcoin and many drifting towards Ethereum, the dilemma of investments becomes a really strenuous choice since the markets are either neutral or quite dull and financial market watchdogs are breathing down the neck of cryptocurrency holders with regulations. It has been shown that there are diversifying interests towards crypto-assets and it is a tough call for crypto traders and buyers in making a choice of ICOs for lucrative returns.A cryptocurrency lottery might seem like a viable option for startups and investors to getting more funds to hold on to. As traditional lotteries are seen as doubtful games, a high level of distrust has been generated between the players and the house.Built with a backbone of blockchain technology, Belotto offers a better lottery service via a decentralized lottery scheme which eliminates jackpot or drawing manipulation as well as misallocation of money.The common transparency issues, lack of reliability, overpriced rates and misappropriation of funds usually experienced by users when playing on and offline lotteries, are solved by Belotto using the high-tech knowledge of Blockchain to manage the services.A solution for both ETH and BTC loversThe lottery scheme offers three startup projects: the Belotto Bitcoin Lottery, Belotto Ether Lottery as well as a BEL Token (Belotto native tokens) lottery offering users an opportunity to win BEL, BTC and ETH Tokens with increased chances of winning (see Whitepaper). This service uses smart contracts for its distribution which solves the reigning issues.The jackpot money is collected through each new ticket purchase and is then stored through escrow to avoid misappropriation issues, winning numbers are extracted from an external public unchangeable and reliable source, smart tickets immediately notify the house and the winner of any jackpot as soon as a win is declared and the money is transferred securely to the winner’s personal wallet, in full.Belotto ensures that either crypto traders and buyers with preferences over one of the two major cryptocurrencies will be satisfied, and the growing interest in Ethereum that India is experiencing is easily settled as the service offers both assets (Bitcoin and Ethereum) for operation.We encourage anyone in the crypto sphere to get acquainted with this project here, and for quicker response at Belotto’s Telegram group.
