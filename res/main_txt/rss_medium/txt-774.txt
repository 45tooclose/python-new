ETH SMART CONTRACTS SECURITY BUGS DISCOVERED…AGAINOn April 22, the world of cryptocurrency was rocked by news of vulnerability of smart contracts when the blockchain security firm Peckshield published their discovery of security bugs that could be exploited resulting in unusual transaction activity such as the transfer of 57.9 * 10⁵⁷ BeautyChain Tokens earlier that day. In related news closely after Smartmesh reported an attack on their smart contract vulnerability, Huobi Pro discovered the abnormal transaction https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0775e55c402281e8ff24cf37d6f2079bf2a768cf7254593287b5f8a0f621fb83 which involved the transfer of a large number of SmartMesh tokens.Both transactions are security bugs; the former transaction is termed as batchOverflow while the latter proxyOverflow, both of which are spread across several Ethereum smart contracts. According to reports other vulnerable tokens include MESH, UGToken, SMT, SMART, MTC, FirstCoin, GG Token, CNY Token, and CNYTokenPlusWhat is batchOverflow?The batchTransfer function in a contract can only transfer tokens that are less than the maximum number of tokens that were generated, therefore creating a cap for the total number of transferable tokens in a transaction. One of the parameters that define the total number of tokens, ‘_value’ can be manipulated creating a ripple effect that enables an attack to be able to send as many tokens as they desire.Artificial creation of tokens is dangerous because it can lead to price manipulation. The distribution of several vulnerable Ethereum tokens in exchanges prompted the response across several exchanges to suspend trading until a more informed decision could be acted upon.Huobi ResponseIn order to ensure users’ protection, Huobi took the precaution of suspending the deposits and withdrawals of all coins once the discovery of abnormal transaction in https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0775e55c402281e8ff24cf37d6f2079bf2a768cf7254593287b5f8a0f621fb83.Later the restriction was only limited to ERC-20 tokens.Other exchangesOKEx, Poloniex, Changelly, Quoine and HitBTC all suspended the trading of ERC-20 tokens immediately the news broke. OKEX came out first, rolling back all trades of BeautyChain Token on April 24. In similar news, OKEx also suspended the deposits and withdrawals of SmartMesh project due to anomalous trading activities. Peckshield inferred the proxyOverflow bug could be culpable for the SmartMesh anomalies, both however are similar in enabling manipulation of parameters to create an abnormally high amount of tokens.Is the ERC-20 token vulnerable?About the recent news, Fabian Vogelsteller said “just show that we need better best practices and tools to detect those mistakes” while TOKPIE’s CEO commented “Firstly, we don’t have the batch transfer function that hackers would use. Secondly, we don’t have an obvious * multiplication, instead we do everything through the mul function. Thus, our token is completely safe from this bug.”Going forward, developers can never be too cautious before deploying smart contracts.
