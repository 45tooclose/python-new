-Investa Banking Ecosystem- is the new breed who will inherit the digital earth!So far a working prototype has been developed in house, which is being tested and updated with more features. Not all parts of the product suite are yet built and the purpose of the ICO is to provide signficant funding to advance the development and product launch. Videos of the prototype have been produced and are available on the Investa website. In due course we will be releasing further beta releases to our test groups in preparation for full roll out of a consumer mobile web application.Investa’s power is in the sum of its parts. Each service is not completely new, but the developers have taken the very best and most popular features from other fintech apps, but combined them together in a powerful and symbiotic ecosystem. This means that you can walk around with a multi toolkit of financial services in the palm of your hand. This has never before been done and the technical evolution is similar in terms of user enablement, to the birth of internet banking 20 years ago…Good luck guys !!
