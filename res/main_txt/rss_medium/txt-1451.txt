SpeedCash Weekly Update — 06.05.2018Happy May, everyone! We hope that you have had a good week, and we can almost guarantee that if you are a SpeedCash holder you did! We would like to start out by acknowledging some momentous milestones that took place for speed cash this week:MilestonesSpeedCash hit the one million market cap point on Monday this week! This is something that we were all happy to celebrate, and we believe that the whole community felt pride in this and the general stable growth that SCS has been able to achieve since January, despite the rest of the market often being down.On the same day, there was even more to celebrate, as it was the first time that SpeedCash had hit a $50,000 volume trading day, which then boosted us to the top of the CoinMarketCap lists for the “24 hour Gainers”at place #1 and “Weekly Gainers” at place #4. This was warmly celebrated across the SpeedCash platforms, and since then, the daily volume has been quite strong in comparison to the weeks before.TechAs discussed last week, the new desktop wallet was being prepared, and the developers didn’t let us down. Version 1.2.4 of the SpeedCash Desktop Wallets have been released for Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Please note that it is no longer required to do a manual backup of the wallet.dat file. You simply just have to delete the old wallet and install the new one. In saying that, we always like to encourage extra safety, and there is no harm in doing a backup. To download the latest version, please check out this page. (Also, if you missed the details of this new version, check out last week’s post, here.)Maintenance on the SpeedCash Block Explorer has officially been completed. Everything is fully operational now, including that of Trusted Signatures support.ExchangesSpeedCash is happy to announce Octaex as the newest exchange to list SpeedCash. Octaex prides themselves on having a reliable system, financial security, and professional support. Additionally, they provide a platform for fast and convenient trading and withdrawals. SpeedCash is actively growing the amount of exchanges in which it is listed. Each addition brings further opportunities for SCS awareness, growth, and trading opportunities.We would also kindly like to say that negotiations are still in progress with HitBTC. Once official decisions have been made, we will of course update the SpeedCash community on all SpeedCash outlets. Until then, we thank you for your continued patience.MarketingThis week, the marketing has been focused on continuing to grow and support the already existing SpeedCash outlets. In doing so, the SpeedCash platforms have seen a steady increase, and we are very happy about this. We are also delighted to see that the community has shown even stronger support this week in the marketing field by sharing posts, infographics, tweets, and more! We are very grateful. If any community members would like a supply of current links/infographics/images, please do not hesitate to reach out to one the admins on Telegram, and we can of course supply you with these.It is also important to note that the SpeedCash team is continuously working behind the scenes to support, improve, and grow SCS. We kindly ask you to keep that in mind, even when some things may seem to have stalled.
