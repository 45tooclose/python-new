CryptoMedicated | James Edwards and Chayleh Tracey FRAUD EXPOSED | PICTURE PROOFJames Edwards also known as “CryptoMedicated” https://twitter.com/CryptoMedicatedand“randomshortdude” https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomshortdudeAnd his other scams which we are going to expose here.Thouartclothing — https://www.facebook.com/ThouArtClothing/TheWriteWorker — https://twitter.com/TheWriteWorkerWhat people don’t know is James’s previous EXIT SCAMS, his racism towards mexicans and the white race, buying followers/likes and retweets on his twitter accounts and using “Chayleh Tracey” as either another pseudonym or an actual person for some dirty work. Lying about money earnt and writing articles on reddit about wanting to kill his ex girlfriend. We will get into all of this with SCREENSHOTS OF EVERYTHING.CryptoMedicatedWe know that they’re connected from this website where James writes some articles.He also admits it here;We see that Chayleh Tracey owns the domain cryptomedication.org.And here where he claims that Chayleh is his ‘girlfriend’.This is where we also find his Instagram profile of “James MiniGod Edwards” “James MiniGod Edwards” use to be his old facebook name as you’ll see below.The hashtag #UMD15 refers to the University of Maryland where he attended, but most likely dropped out. This explains his scams which we will get into.He also lives in Maryland according to his facebook.Here we have “Chayleh Tracey”’s Instagram profile as well.Now lets get into James’s first exit scam.He use to own a business called “thouartclothing” and the facebook page called “Thouartclothing” where he has bragged that it made $100k on twitter.Clicking on the link you see it refers to the clothing company “thouartclothing”.The owner came under the name Chayleh Tracey.His twitter account @Cryptomedicated is the old @Thouartclothing twitter handle which he has since changed. You can see he use to promote it. We’ll only screenshot a few for proof, but there’s many, many more. Like 100’s of tweets of him promoting ThouArtClothing.You can start to see the huge amount of people that have been RIPPED OFF. Just search “thouartclothing” in the twitter search bar for these results.He then becomes racist with the customers he scams, unprovoked.He’s acted like this before, though.Then we get into the facebook page with, again, a crazy amount of people wanting their money back after not receiving their order.I’m sure you get the picture. We can’t say he’s a scammer or a bad guy, but this is the evidence that we have found and have brought forth. It is up to you to make a judgement call.We have also seen him promote this under his reddit account “randomshortdude” — even worse he’s pretending not to own it. Lol. This is sad.First a post to show you that this is his reddit account:(He also moderates his own subreddit with this username)Now watch him spam reddit to SCAM more people pretending he has nothing to do with the business.The reason why he calls himself “randomshortdude”, “Minigod” etc. is because he’s tiny at 5 foot. He’s a midget. An angry midget that scams people.You may have also seen him identify himself on his “personal twitter” account @pete_mercuryIts well known that he’s bought followers on his twitter account CryptoMedication which he continues to deny.But, this leads us to his other scam and ANOTHER account which he purchased followers, likes and retweets to look more legitimate than what he is.He even posts his photo on both accounts, Thouartclothing AND TheWriteWorker:Lets see how his TheWriteWorker account stacks up for fake followers.Now his CryptoMedication twitter.See a pattern here? He buys followers for all his accounts to fraudulently come across as more legitimate then he is. This is FRAUD. The SEC and the FBI have been notified!!!!!!!1111!!!!!!Now lets look at some of his posts that he’s purchased likes and retweets for.1,500 retweets and ONLY 112 LIKES?What does a real post of his look like?ZERO FOR EVERYTHING! LOL.Now lets look at some other posts he’s got. Will it be organic? Ha.Nothing fishy going on here! And guess what this thread was for? To show you ‘happy’ customers from the service. Again, he’s making it look ‘legit’ because he isn’t. No doubt there were that many likes as well except they have all dropped off just leaving the retweets there.Same thing. 238 retweets and 119 likes. If you actually go through the screenshots, the amount of messages in the top left hand corner doesn’t change from (52). He shows around 14 messages. He’s literally sending messages to himself pretending to be a customer.Where have we seen this before?He’s also claimed to make $200,000 on an XRP trade.This makes no sense for someone starting their own paid group because he has no money and has a family to look after. He offered to work for a month for free but it wasn’t ‘feasible’… what happened to that 200k easy trade, little buddy?And the fact he was desperately trying to find a writing job and applied to everything he could on redditEven though he makes 15k/M writing articles…He was making 5k/w before this as well and bragging that BitcoinBravado would retweet him.But, when it comes down to it, he can’t afford to do anything free because he has no money, so he has to promote his paid group which is a scam like him.What’s crazier is we have the reddit screenshots from his reddit account “randomshortdude” about him wanting to kill his ex gf.Check this thread here -> https://warosu.org/biz/thread/7778077There’s also claims from that link that there’s evidence of him accessing child pornography under the name “NiggerManlet”.RIP.[ Looking at James, he may be a smart guy who’s just had a life of bad luck which has made him scam people for money and act fraudulently, this article in no way intends to defame his credibility or his stature in the community. He’s probably pretty laid back and just wants to chill.These are just the facts we have found and felt that we should let the community know because as a journalist facts are all that matters.
