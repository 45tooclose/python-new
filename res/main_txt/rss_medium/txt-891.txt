Why would this global land registry require any 3rd party to give it legitimacy?The beauty of employing blockchain as a solution for land titling is that it eliminates any need for 3rd parties whatsoever. Land owners need only host a node in exchange for registration, so there is no cost. Because the registry is self hosted, there is no requirement for government to bequeath ownership nor maintain any record of it, and because the transactions are immutable, there is no need for title companies to insure the legitimacy of any claim.The premise of your article is exactly right, however. There is no use case for private blockchain. The part and parcel of blockchain is to free us from the yoke of those entities that presume to confer upon us that which is rightfully ours. Any legitimate blockchain is accessible to anyone with a vested interest in it and is open and discoverable to all.
