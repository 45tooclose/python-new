No trade zone — May 2nd Crypto UpdateCrypto Update 2nd May 2018We don’t recommend trading now as BTC is forming a triangle which means it can really go in any direction. It is better to stay on the sidelines and wait for the situation to clarify. Vey hard to predict what will unfold in the upcoming hours/days. If you decide to go short then stop loss should be above triangle (resistance). If you decide to go long then stop loss should be below triangle.Bitcoin chartWhat will happen to altcoins? It was a pretty good week for altcoins so you should be probably satisfied now. If you want to accumulate altcoins, buy only those with strong fundamentals and are LOW. Do not buy altcoins that have pumped already (like EOS) until we suggest otherwise. Such trading may be very harmful to your portfolio as potential gains will not be impressive, however, a potential loss can diminish your portfolio substantially.Disclaimer: information provided by @cryptomedics does not constitute as investment advice, financial advice, trading advice, or any other sort of advice, and you should not treat any of the website’s content as such.
