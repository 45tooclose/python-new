Introducing ETERBASEFirst-wave exchanges are failing. Although they have built some good practices, existing exchanges just can’t keep up with demand. Bittrex, Bitfinex, Binance, and others have all suspended user registrations at some point because their systems cannot keep pace with demand.[i][ii] Sadly, first-wave exchanges also suffer from a raft of other problems including juvenile interfaces, slow trade execution, and phenomenally poor customer service.We’re proud to offer you ETERBASE — Europe’s premier digital asset exchange.We consider ETERBASE to be a second-wave exchange. Using our combined experience in the financial industry and cryptocurrency exchanges, we have identified the best practices of existing exchanges and eliminated the bad to set the new gold-standard for digital asset exchanges.Our robust, safe platform offers powerful, Wall Street-level trading tools to everyone, no matter what level of trading experience they have. Additionally, our intuitive user interface allows traders to access a range of powerful features with a single click instead of navigating page after clunky page of information.One area that we identified as lacking in first-wave exchanges was compliance with regulations. Just like traditional financial institutions, ETERBASE is fully compliant with all existing financial regulations and, therefore, we adhere to the most stringent, robust legal and regulatory frameworks to provide a safer trading experience for all.First-wave exchanges have been a necessary onboarding tool for millions of people globally to access cryptocurrencies — it is only natural that they have become overwhelmed since they did not anticipate such mass adoption. At ETERBASE, we have taken a long-term view regarding our platform and designed it to scale to as many traders who want to use it.Over the next few days, we’ll be giving you an insider look at our platform and going into greater detail about what makes ETERBASE Europe’s premier digital asset exchange.
