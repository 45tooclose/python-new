Rublix is now LIVE on QRYPTOSQUOINE and Rublix are pleased to announce the listing of Rublix token on QRYPTOS (https://qryptos.com).QRYPTOS is QUOINE’s fully digital cryptocurrency exchange and trading platform launched in June 2017.Rublix is building a platform where participants can access trusted trading information from blockchain-verified experts. The goal is to help traders enhance their skills, confidence and profitability in any industry they trade in.Rublix is developing an ecosystem powered by smart contracts and coin rewards where newcomers to the trading industry can learn from more sophisticated traders with blockchain-verified track records.The premier tool within the Rublix platform is “Hedge”, a networking hub for financial and cryptocurrency traders and those newcomers seeking to learn up-to-the-minute market information, trading strategies and price predictions. The platform will incorporate blockchain technology directly into the functionality whereby content creators, analysts and traders, will submit predictions or “Blueprints” into a smart contract that will execute true or false results based on the real outcome in the market. In other words, the system will be able to compare market predictions coded into each smart contract-powered Blueprint with real market information and execute positive or negative rankings for the trader based on the end result.Traders who correctly anticipate market movements will automatically be rewarded positive ranking points on the Hedge platform based on the smart contract authority. Blueprints will thus carry an intrinsic value and users can “buy” them using RBLX tokens to “unlock” or gain access to the information therein. The higher the trader’s ranking on Hedge (calculated by Hedge’s Proof-of-Ranking/Achievement algorithm), the more expensive the Blueprint. Users will also be able to view historical predictions as the each Blueprint will be posted on the blockchain and the traders profile. This ranking system and level of validation will greatly enhance traders’ credibility, transparency and ability to attract purchasers of their Blueprints, in addition to filtering out poor performers with unproven track records.Furthermore, once users on the platform purchase the Blueprints to unlock the prediction, the trader will only receive the RBLX tokens if his Blueprint is correct. If the prediction is incorrect, the RBLX tokens will be returned to the user, thus further incentivizing useful and accurate trading predictions.For more information, see rublix.ioRublix Video: vimeo.com/251390018Rublix Blog: blog.rublix.ioRublix Whitepaper: rublix.io/wpTelegram: t.me/rublixdevReddit: reddit.com/r/RublixTwitter: twitter.com/rublixdevFacebook: facebook.com/rublixdevInstagram: instagram.com/rublixdevLinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/rublixdev/Steem: steemit.com/@rublixdevBitcoin Talk Post: bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2880980GitHub repo: github.com/rublixdev
