ORBIS WORLDWIDE BRANCHES AND FRANCHISINGFranchising in a method for expanding a business and distributing goods and services through a licensing relationship. In franchising, franchisors not only specify the products and services that will be offered by the franchisees but also provide them with an operating system, brand and support. In our vision, Orbis will exist also physically in well-developed self-service futuristic branches designed by our designers. These will consist in self-service Atm machines which will have all the functions that our customers will have on their smart-phones and desktop platforms and also cash dispersing function.The least but not last function in our branches will be the Virtual Reality information and customer service stands, where our customers will receive information from a artificial intelligence human chat robot, using Virtual Reality technology, this consist in a stand with VR Glasses that will transmute the customer into a virtual chamber where he will have the opportunity to make virtual conversations with one of our AI VR customer service chat robots. Being a self-service business the monthly costs of owning such a franchise would be insignificant comparing to the profits. Owning Orbis branches all over the world would be almost impossible for a single company so the best chance to bring the Orbis concept worldwide would be to franchise the company so we can also share our profits with the community.
