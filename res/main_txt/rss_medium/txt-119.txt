How to act accordingly to altcoin bullruns — a simple calculation.Hello dear reader,first of all i want to thank you for reading my first Medium post. I am trying to tell my story as short as possible: I’m into Cryptocurrency since 2016, i am interrested in PoS coins, masternodes and trading — but i’m also a Hodler. And because i had my biggest gains by just holding assets, i wanted to do a quantitativ comparison between altcoins during bullruns. My thesis is: Do altcoins, independend of their market value correlate during bull / bear phases and how can we make use of our findings to trade more effective?To check this assumption, i am going to take 10 Cryptocurrency mostly known of the community. I am only going to check large and midcaps as i don’t think i’m able to evaluate smallcaps with little liquidity. I know small caps are a great oppurtinity for giant gains, but after being around for a while now i’m at a point where i’m not searching for x50 coins, but i’m searching for stable, valuable projects which will give me a x5 or so. So what do we need for our research? We need projects with a history — for my research i’m going to take projects which had outlived at least two Altcoin Bullruns.I decided to check: Large caps: ETH, XRP , LTC, NEO, NEM Mid caps: XVG, UBQ, DGB, LBC, NXTAs there are no clear dates where alt markets are starting, i’m going to take averages for my theory. The first altcoin market we will take care off is the altcoin market from May — June 2017. We will take 05/01/17 as our starting point. As coinmarketcap shows us, after Wave 1 as prepump, alts started to fly around this date. At the peak of this cycle, the marketcap excluding Bitcoin was around 70 Billion Dollars. This would be an average growth of x4.666.0Now let’s look at our choosen ones (todays large caps):Ethereum made a 216% jump in 43 days. click here for coinigy chartRipple made 618% in 16 days.click here for coinigy chart.LTC made 115% in 9 and 64 days. -> we are taking their average, so 37 days. click here for coinigy chartNeo did 1500% in 49 days. click here for coinigy chartNEM did 270% in about 17 days. click here for coinigy chartWhen we are calculating the average of these we are getting:43 + 16 + 37 + 49 + 17 = 162 / 5→ 32,4 days as an average timeframe for achiving a peak during an alt run for large caps.Now we are considering mid caps:XVG took 35 days to peak. click here for coinigy chartUBQ needed 41 days to it’s high. click here for coinigy chartDGB needed about 32 days. click here for coinigy chartLBC needed 51 days. click here for coinigy chartNXT run was about 43 days long.click here for coinigy chartwhen we are calculating the average here we are getting: 35 + 41 +32 + 51 +43 = 202 / 5 → An average of 40,4 days to peak on mid caps.Now we need to look on the next altcoin market to collect as much data as possible to minimize the standart deviation. That’s why we are looking at the next altcoin cycle in December 2017. We will take the 9. december as starting point because i think this is a date where alts were prepumped a little and started flying. The high of this cycle was about 547 Billion dollar excluding Bitcoin. As it’s not easy to identify exact beginnings and endings of markets (because it’s established practice that an asset, which is pumping first peaked before an asset that startet pumping later. Common example: People pumping Coinbase, than discovering trex or binance, then pumping shittopia…) we are working with averages.So let’s have a look:Ethereum needed 55 days. click here for coinigy chartRipple needed 25 days to peak.click here for coinigy chart.LTC made needed 11 days. click here for coinigy chartNeo took about 51 days. click here for coinigy chartNEM needed 25 days. click here for coinigy chartWhen we are calculating the average of these we are getting:55 + 25 + 11 + 51 + 24= 167 / 5→ 33,4 days as an average timeframe for achiving a peak during an alt run for large caps.Now we are considering mid caps again:XVG took 14 days to peak. click here for coinigy chartUBQ needed 51 days to it’s high. click here for coinigy chartDGB needed about 28 days. click here for coinigy chartLBC needed 35 days. click here for coinigy chartNXT run was about 15 days long.click here for coinigy chartwhen we are calculating the average here we are getting: 14 + 51+28 + 35+15 = 143 / 5 → An average of 28,6 days to peak on mid caps.What do we see? We see that altcoin bullruns are faster than most people are expecting. That’s why so many people are bagholding. They are fomoing in, holding too long and are REKT for months. I made this mistakes too and i’m not trusting anyone who says he doesn’t know this.Now let’s calculate an average of all givien data:43 + 16 +37 + 49 + 17 + 35 +41 + 32 + 51 +43 + 55 +25 +11 + 51 +25 + 14 + 51 +28 +35 +15 = 674 / 20→ 33,7 days in average until the blowoff and bear market begins again.The ratio between bull and bear markets in crypto is suspicious (I would say 1:5). As many new investors know charts against north for years from stocks etc, the crypto market is predistined to blow off really fast. Followed by a long time of accumulation.So, let’s take our 33,7 days average and apply it to the market. What would have happened, if we sold off after 33–34 days?Ethereum:Ripple:Litecoin:Neo:Nem:XVG:UBQ:DGB:LBC:NXT:As you can see, in 19 of 20 cases it would have been possible to create an huge ROI. Only in the second NXT trade you would have a loss of about 20%. But only because NXT were blowing up because of the Ignis Airdrop at this time, an external factor we did not calculate with.As conclusion: Yes, i think there are correlations between Altcoins and their bullruns. They are showing similiar patterns every time. If you combine this newly won knowledge with simple T.A and sentiment analysis, you will be able to increase your portfolio value exponentiall. Be strong enough to sell! Don’t become a bagholder!I hope you learned something about the right timing in markets.King regards,MariusTwitter: https://twitter.com/mariusfireMail: Marius@altcoin.team
