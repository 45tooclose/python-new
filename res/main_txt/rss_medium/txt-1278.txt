Coral and Deco Network: Trusted Transfers and Building BlocksAt Coral, we’re building predictive analytics for blockchain transactions. Our sophisticated, patented algorithms can determine the likelihood that someone is about to send money to a phishing scam. Our mission is to clean up fraud in blockchains, creating a base-layer of trust upon which blockchain can gain mass adoption.To accomplish this mission in its entirety, Coral Protocol will need to be compatible with every blockchain in existence, and every new blockchain still to come. This undertaking has led us to partner with Deco Network, who is building a scalable infrastructure for incentivizing the development of open source projects. With Deco Network, Coral will be able to reward bounties to developers for successfully developing block explorers for Coral Protocol on new blockchains.“Deco solves a big scalability issue for us” says David Kuchar, Coral’s CEO. “Rather than hiring hundreds of specialized developers in house, we can simply put up a development bounty on Deco for one or multiple projects, achieving much needed elasticity in our development process.”On top of bringing speed and flexibility to Coral’s engineering roadmap, Deco Network will be integrating the Coral Protocol into its platform to prevent phishing fraud in bounty payments.“We will have thousands of large bounties being paid every day on Deco,” says David Sneider, CEO of Deco Network. “These bounties may be targeted by scammers. Integrating with Coral will give all parties on our platform peace of mind that their money is getting where it’s going.”Blockchain adoption is still at its infancy stage. To get to maturity, it will take large amounts of trust and large amounts of development work. By partnering up, Coral and Deco aim to take a big step towards the future.Learn more about Deconet:Web: https://deco.network/Telegram: https://t.me/deco_networkTwitter: https://twitter.com/deco_networkLearn more about Coral Protocol:Web: https://heycoral.comTelegram: https://t.me/heycoralTwitter: https://twitter.com/coralprotocol
