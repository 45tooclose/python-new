Introducing Levitears and a little about RecyclingRecently, a new module called Levitears appeared in CryptoBots. This is a common 5th class ear module that you have a high chance of receiving as a prize for winning battles (you can read more about classes in the article on the New Battle Balance).What makes battle prizes special is that they are not generated for sale at auction in the form of Gen 0. Gen 0 Bots with reward module can only be obtained as specific rewards. For example, in the current tournament you can win a Gen 0 Bot with the legendary module Dread or a Gen 0 with the epic module Circular Saw.However, with the introduction of Recycling, there is now a chance of obtaining a Gen 0 with a module of any rarity (with the exception of special modules: Ether, Thrust, and Fancy).Do not miss the opportunity to create an amazing combination of modules with the help of Recycling!Read more about CryptoBots onÂ Medium:RecyclingNew Battle BalanceManufacturing Cooldown Guide
