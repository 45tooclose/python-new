Genomics;The future made promising with project ShivomCarla is a thirty two year old banker, she has a successful career, she’s the branch manager of the bank where she works, Carla’s family are happy with her cos she’s the bread winner she takes care of everyone and everything.Carla is so busy, she has no time to fall in love,get married and have kids, she would’ve loved to but simply can’t,so she decides to have a baby through artificial insemination ,she makes a wish list of all the qualities she wants in her future baby,she wants blue eyes,brown hair,she doesn’t want her child to develop diabetes or hypertension in the future and the list goes on,she takes this list to the sperm bank only to be told only a few of this information ;mainly phenotypic is available concerning the potential sperm donors,she insists that there’s supposed to be some kind of a way to get this information,she visits three more sperm banks and she’s given the same gist.Carla is disappointed,she has to engage is something so important without all the details she desires.A lot of “Carlas” exist in the world today, could there be an end in sight for their present predicament? Could the thousands of “Carlas” one day walk into any sperm bank and obtain the genomic information on potential sperm donors in order to ascertain that their future children will not be at any risk of having a debilitating disease in the future?Yes,all these are on the horizon, introducing project Shivom,a platform that helps people acquire their genome sequence,store it,share it or obtain rewards for sharing it,it’s a platform that provides a secure decentralized database where genomic information is only accessible to individuals or third parties with individual’s consent, project Shivom provides a platform where pharmaceutical companies study human genome, conduct efficient drug testing by choosing drug trial subjects more precisely and accurately, project Shivom also provides a platform where the human genome can be studied and defective or vulnerable genes are mapped out in order to prevent future occurrences of certain genetically associated diseases.The key to this bank of information is the OmiX tokens from Shivom, these tokens gives individuals ability to acquire genome sequencing kits, sponsor sequencing projects, access the genomic database and also gives ability to service providers like Carla’s sperm bank to use the platform.This project is a light at the end of the tunnel for millions on earth like Carla,you could be a part of something great, something historic, something useful.For more information on project Shivom visit,Shivom websitehttps://shivom.io/Telegram. https://t.me/projshivomANN thread. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3204563.0
