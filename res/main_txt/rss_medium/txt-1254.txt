Quarkchain — The Future is here — High Throughput BlockchainIn scientific terms, “Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are protons and neutrons, the components of atomic nuclei”.(High Capacity Transactional System)QuarkChain is a blockchain system that uses sharding mechanism to provide a high-capacity peer-to-peer transactional system. Quarkchain consists of two major layers.Two main layers are:Sharding layer — represents ledger, performs transactions and records results.Root layer — confirms the result of the transactions from ledger and mines the block.QuarkChain aims to solve decentralization, security, and scalability.Nodes and Clusters are used for mining on the Quarkchain platform. Multiple nodes form a cluster and serves the purpose of supernode. This provides a better environment for the miners.Quarkchain is trying to achieve the perfect balance between the 3 pillars of blockchain technology — scalability, decentralization, and security.ScalabilityIn any blockchain, 2 basic functionalities are performed in all the blocks — Ledger, which notes down the details of transactions in the block, and Confirmation, which confirms the results of these transactions and mines the block.Quarkchain splits these functionalities into 2 distinct layers. It has an elastic sharding blockchain layer, which contains a list of mini-blockchains or shards, and a root blockchain, called the rootchain.DecentralizationIn case of traditional blockchains, each miner has to mine the full block to earn the block reward.Quarkchain has several shards (or mini-blockchains), each with their own mining difficulty and associated mining power required. A miner could choose a block depending on his mining or hash power.The nodes in the Quarkchain ecosystem which validate blocks are called ‘super-full nodes’. For a high-throughput system like Quarkchain, running a super-full node would require a massive hash power, which would again encourage the involvement of mining pools.SecurityThe rootchain has more than 50% of the hashing power of the entire network. A double-spend attack on the rootchain would require the attacker to have more than 25% of the network’s hash power.Team & Advisors The QuarkChain core team has years of development experience and deep technical skills. Qi Zhou, PhD is an expert in high performance systems.
