This can be achieved only by expanding our team which requires a lot of funds.C.

The token will be a mean of payment within the network.The total supply of the TNS token is 120 million and has a maximum of 18 decimal places. This is a fixed supply and will not decrease or increase, the decision of the total supply was made by the Transcodium team and founders.EACH TOKEN OFFERS THE FOLLOWING RIGHTS TO ITS HOLDER:Right to transaction: Each token holder holds the right to send or receive tokens between one to another.
