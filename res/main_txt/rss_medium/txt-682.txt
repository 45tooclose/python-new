About Criptoreal PremineOriginally, premine or instamine of altcoins was viewed with reticence by the great majority of the community.This is because, at the beginning of the altcoins, some 5–6 years ago, when the first altcoins with premine were released, their creators did so with the expectation of making easy money.Since then, many things have changed, everything that is related to the development and disclosure of a crypto-currency, saw its costs skyrocket, from the simple blog posting of the area to the inclusion of the new currency in exchanges, everything is paid.(for example, the Copper Member on Bitcoin Talk that reduces the time Newbie needs to wait to reply messages or put images in posts costs BTC 0.00208333, see our payment here)The subject of the Criptoreal premine was extensively discussed among developers, after all, we want a fair currency for the community and, above all, we cherish the transparency of the project.The consensus was to launch the Criptoreal with a premiere of CRS 5 million, approximately 2.4% of the total issue, which does not represent a risk to the community and allows us to devote resources to the growth and dissemination of the currency.(Considering that: CRS 120 per block — 1 block every 2 minutes, 720 blocks per day = CRS 86400, in approximately 2 months, the community will have the equivalent of the total premine)In addition, the premiere of the Criptoreal was divided into five parts (8 blocks) that further reduce centralization, they are:Block # 1 — Development Fund: CRS 1,000,000Aimed at developers, this is, in fact, the only amount that will be held by Criptoreal developers.Blocks # 2 to # 5 — Pre-CFC: 1,500,000Sold at R $ 1 with 50% bonus for four investors with the condition that they are not sold before three years. (Similar to Stellar with Stripe).Block # 6 — CFC Fund: CRS 1,875,000Intended for the collective funding campaign (crowdfunding campaign) of the Criptoreal with a date to be defined.Block # 7 — Bounty Fund: CRS 450,000Intended for bounties (rewards) for the Criptoreal community.Block # 8 — Giveaway Fund: CRS 175,000Intended for faucets, sweepstakes, airdrops and other means of free distribution in order to increase the reach and adoption of the Criptoreal.We believe that with the distribution described above, we can achieve the “best of both worlds”, a fair and transparent crypto-currency, but also capable of sustaining itself in the long run.
