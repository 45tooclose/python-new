The big problems of travel market!Only a small part of the big partnership announcementAndrew Dutov, Roomdao, CEO:Today there are certain problems at the tourism market that require improvement for the convenience of the travelers.For example:Companies like Expedia.com and Booking.com are trying to fully control the tourism market. Giving preferences to the big service suppliers and ignoring the small business, they actually destroy small companies that provide their service much cheaper and at the better conditions. Last year the thousands of tourism companies were closed, as major players tried to monopolize the tourism market. Roomdao develops p2p booking system, that gives possibilities to any tourism service provider like Host, Car Rent, Transfer, Bus, guides and etc. offer their services to the tourist directly.Major companies take huge fees, but at the end there fees are paid by the tourist or the suppliers. For example, Expedia charges 21%, Booking.com — even 23%.The financial structure of Roomdao works in different way.We are not trying to slip our hands into the travelers’ pocket.We create the platform that will not charge fees, and it will attract the users and will make the travelling more attracting and available.ROOMDAO — INNOVATIVE LOWCOST PLATFORM!
