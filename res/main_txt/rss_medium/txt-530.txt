The future with DISC tokenMany people ask me about our upcoming ICO for DISCOPERI, Inc.. And even though we haven’t started presale yet, I can give you a tip on how the future of automotive world looks like.Imagine you’re driving down the road. And there is an accident. You passed by. Thanks to #System_EYE brought by DISCOPERI, Inc. the accident has been scanned and captured in details (not 100% though). System EYE decomposes the video stream and sends to the cloud a small encrypted code with what happened out there. In the cloud the data is validated and notifications to other cars in the area are sent. Once all the data points from many (not just your) cars, which captured the accident, collected, the data is grouped and a hash is created into the blockchain.Once the buyer is there (let’s say an insurance company or a fleet owner) — he/she uses our application to choose which of the data to buy and pays for it with #DISC tokens. Once the payment is executed a smart contract, created just recently according to buyer’s needs (e.g. price, # of cars, etc.) is executed and closed. You as a driver receive DISCs and now can use them to exchange on new services and products, while the buyer gets the data.The process is pure, easy, transparent and fair. You, as a driver, don’t need to do anything else, but switch on System EYE while driving. The rest our system will do for you. That’s how you can become a “Driving Miner”.
