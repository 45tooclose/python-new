For this, of course, there is no better place than Keynote’s World Blockchain Forum!Attending the event were Co-Founder & COO, Khalid Maliki; Business Development Lead, Jimmy J.P. Snoek, and Compliance Officer (Lebanon), Randa Rifai; accompanied by Blockchain Architect Weiwu Zhang, on invitation by the organiser of the forum, Dr. Moe Levin, Strategic Advisor to Tykn.On the first day, Khalid presented Tykn’s distributed identity attestation authority system, ANA, to large-scale investors, entrepreneurs & government officials alike, and the attention and interest it garnered was truly overwhelming! The event allowed us to make many wonderful and exciting connections, with many of whom we will be discussing our contribution to the identity & humanitarian aid space within the UAE and other parts of the globe on the short term!In the meantime, the team is working hard on the writing of both a white and two yellow (technical) papers (to be released in May) explaining the magic of ANA, and to have her test-ready for our upcoming pilot in St. Martin together with the 510 Data Team, for The Netherlands Red Cross.To get a taste of what the World Blockchain Forum in Dubai was like this year, check out Keynote’s highlight video below! The next iteration of the WBF will be in New York on June 11–13.For more information, please visit https://tykn.tech!
