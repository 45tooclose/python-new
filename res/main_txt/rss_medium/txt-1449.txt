MONORETO Make it Easy to Use Social NetworksData for January 2018 shows that 2.5 billion people on Earth use social networks every day and post a variety of content ranging from text and photographs to comments and likes.Social network users can be sorted into three categories:Professional bloggers, opinion makers, photographers (when creation of content is a source of professional income)Regular users who post quality content but don’t have the opportunity to monetize itRegular users who do not create quality content (or any content at all) but make use of someone else’s product (photographs, posts, comments)Only a small percentage of users, those included in the first category, are able to monetize their publications by cooperating with brands and companies that promote their services. A significant number of social network users that create high quality and popular content don’t have the opportunity to make money from it (the second category). What happens is that the content earns money for the companies that own the social networks as opposed to the creators themselves. This is how Facebook’s market value has reached $350 billion to date and continues to grow first and foremost because of user content.The overwhelming number of social media users is the audience (the third category). They usually do not create their own content but actively use social networks, ranking and commenting on content posted by others and also communicating with each other. This is the audience that creates the added value of a social network as a product.MAIN PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONSPROGRESSIVE SOLUTIONSManage your account and earnLike and become popularRaise fundsParticipate in charityAdvertise your business in an effective wayTo solve this problem, a team of specialists has developed the innovative MonoretoMonoreto is a social network that :Gives every user the opportunity to earn from posting photos and videosIncreases the significance and value of likes and improves the overall quality of contentReduces the need for blogger ads as a monetization methodMakes fake likes and bots unprofitableProject IdeologyEach of these user categories needs to have several important psychological and economic attributes:Creative fulfillmentCompassionRecognition of talent and professional skillsEarning incomeOverview of Social Networking (Facebook and Instagram)Statistics shows that the two most popular social networks in the world are Facebook and Instagram.Data from the Social Media Marketing Industry Report 2018 indicates that Facebook and Instagram are the main social platforms used by businesses and demonstrated positive dynamics in 2017 compared to 2016.Monetization of Daily Use by Regular UsersMonoreto will make communication even easier and more convenient.
