User-Controlled Storage with NicholasWe sat down with Nicholas Fisher, one of Skrumble’s newest frontend developers to learn more about the Skrumble Network decentralized application features, User-Controlled Storage, and how it works.Watch the video or read the interview below!“Hey, I’m Nicholas and I’m a Frontend Developer at Skrumble. I’m here to talk about Skrumble Network’s User-Controlled Storage and how it works.Because Skrumble Network is using blockchain technology, the only thing stored is the session ID and any financial information if a transaction has occurred.But, with our unique User-Controlled Storage, users can choose to save a record of their conversation.When starting a new conversation, the participants entering the conversation can select to save and store their messages, files, call history, and more.If each user agrees, the conversation records will be stored using file servers in the cloud.Using one of Skrumble’s 30+ global patents in file storage, the files will be separated into pieces and stored in different locations across the network, to ensure user records are safe.Only users with the unique conversation key who participated in the original conversation will be permitted to access the saved information.For more information, visit skrumble.network and download our whitepaper. Thanks for watching!” — Nicholas Fisher, Frontend Developer at Skrumble.
