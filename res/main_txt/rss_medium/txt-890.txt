Automated trading… the new norm?Here’s a thought for today… something that has & continues to bother me regarding trading in the financial markets. Don’t get me wrong I am all for technology & innovation but feel that trading has become a little too automated for an average investor like me… trading bots, Algorithmic trading & more recently AI trading models.On a typical day 50–60% of the trading decisions are made by computers & this ratio jumps to as high as 90% with any bouts of volatility spikes — point I am trying to make is all machines think the same way based on the input parameters on which they function, so when the trigger point comes in all the algorithms kick in causing massive momentum swings burning many investors in the process. Recent example was in February this year when the DOW shed more than a 1100 points in day!Human contribution continues to wane in the market direction determination with all this automation. I just feel at some point in the very near future the good old buy & hold strategy (specially for stocks) is going to become history — not that I mind it much being a day trader myself but there should be some kind of safety valve (apart from halting the trade altogether) if all hell breaks lose with machines taking over! Again volatility is not a bad thing — just ask the Crypto & Forex traders — but if it gets out of hand only then…What do you guys think… feel free to comment or give any feedback. Happy Trading!
