Farewell, Bounty campaign. Hello, 1 million NUG to be won!We love our Nuggets community. Since the year began, it’s increased by well over 2,000% — a phenomenal growth rate. And we couldn’t have achieved that without you. Thank you so much for all your help, whatever part you’ve played in the Nuggets story so far.Activities like our Bounty and Airdrop campaigns have been critical in our growth, and we’re thinking all the time about new ways to inspire and reward the community. It’s also important to judge when something’s run its course, and we’ve decided that’s the case with the bounty campaign. So we’ve now closed that campaign.Now we’re ready for the next stage. There’s plenty of news to come, so stay tuned for some exciting announcements in the weeks and months ahead.That said, you won’t have to wait long for a chance to get more NUG. We just put one million NUG up for grabs in a new competition. All you have to do is answer three questions telling us why you love Nuggets so much, and you could win a share of those 1,000,000 NUG. Get involved here.And our Airdrop campaign is still open. We’re offering 60 million NUG to a total of 50,000 participants. Each participant will get 600 NUG for signing up, and 600 more for referring a friend who goes on to participate. So if you haven’t signed up yet, head over to WeStart now.We’ll also be launching several new competitions and initiatives over the next few weeks, giving you the chance to get even more goodies. So keep your eyes peeled on Telegram! And thanks again for everything — this journey just keeps getting more exciting.
