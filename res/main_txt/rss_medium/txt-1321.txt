Cobinhood Crypto Currency HODLI have been a holder of $COB since the launch. I have seen my holdings hit massive peaks when the coin was over $1.00. Since that time Cobinhood hit some tough times like other cryptos, but the recovery has been very slow.This was (IMO) in part to when Cobinhood lost the feature of USD Fiat deposits. They are working on this feature, but that hit the crypto hard.Since that time Cobinhood has made real strides. One of the biggest complaints is that the trading volume is low, but that has really turned the corner. The volume overall on major coins on Cobinhood is in a place where you can get good fills. My optimism for $COB is back.CobinhoodCobinhood also runs many trading contests and features using a concept of a “Candy Machine” where if you trade certain pains you will get a spin on the machine and rewards (free tokens). This introduces you to many of the ICOs that have taking place on Cobinhood. Many times the rewards are low (one or two tokens) but hey if you are trading why not scoop some up.Cobinhood Candy MachineTake the time to join Cobinhood and HODL some $COB.
