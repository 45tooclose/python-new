Before you can understand ethereum, it helps to first understand the internet.Today, our personal data, passwords and financial information are all largely stored on other people’s computers — in clouds and servers owned by companies like Amazon, Facebook or Google. Even this CoinDesk article is stored on a server controlled by a company that charges to hold this data should it be called upon.This setup has a number of conveniences, as these companies deploy teams of specialists to help store and secure this data, and remove the costs that come with hosting and uptime.But with this convenience, there is also vulnerability. As we’ve learned, a hacker or a government can gain unwelcome access to your files without your knowledge, by influencing or attacking a third-party service — meaning they can steal, leak or change important information. Ethereum is one of the newest technologies to join this movement.While bitcoin aims to disrupt PayPal and online banking, ethereum has the goal of using a blockchain to replace internet third parties — those that store data, transfer mortgages and keep track of complex financial instruments. Ethereum, if all goes according to plan, would return control of the data in these types of services to its owner and the creative rights to its author.The idea is that one entity will no longer have control over your notes and that no one could suddenly ban the app itself, temporarily taking all of your notebooks offline. Only the user can make changes, not any other entity.In theory, it combines the control that people had over their information in the past with the easy-to-access information that we’re used to in the digital age. Each time you save edits or add or delete notes, every node on the network makes the change.About the Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference SwitzerlandOn September 19–20, 2018 the company “Smile-Expo” will arrange the second blockchain conference in Geneve.Conference gathered the brightest experts of the industry, well-known specialists, and gurus of the crypto market, developers, and entrepreneurs, representatives of payment systems, and lawyers who shared their way of thinking concerning blockchain technology development across the globe.Crypto market analysis, business solutions within FinTech achievements, Blockchain and Bitcoin prospects, cutting-edge technologies and technical aspects of working with the smart technology, the latest regulatory changes, Bitcoin mining and exchange — all these topics and more will be raised at the Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference Geneva on September 19–20, 2018.Exhibition areaExplore new blockchain software and technological solutions in the exhibition area at Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference Switzerland. Developers will present their recent creations and answer questions regarding their functional features as well as we’re glad to discuss cooperation opportunities.The exhibition area is a comfortable space for business communications, allowing all attendees to find new business partners and determine further ways of business growth.Land Securities Group, the largest UK Property Firm is adopting the Blockchain Technology in the near future.The Largest UK Commercial Property Development and Investment CompanyL has said that the blockchain will ‘absolutely’ play a role in its business. Land Securities Group, or Landsec, owns and manages over 26,000,000 square feet of commercial property, from London’s offices and high street shops to those of major shopping centers and retail parks. It also owns the advertising Piccadilly Lights in Piccadilly Circus, London.In a CNBC interview, Robert Noel, CEO of Landsec, was asked whether the blockchain would be used in the company. He said: Absolutely … If you look at the way what we provide, which is services to business, and those services are around contract, anything that speeds up archaic land law, and contract law, and leasing law will be welcomed.With the use of the technology in Landsec’s services, it could help to speed up processes, particularly those that require the signing of contracts and extensive paperwork. This, in turn, would help to cut down on the amount of time needed to go back and forth between varying parties. Through the blockchain, each party involved would have access to an immutable copy of the contract, which is automatically executed when each party completes their part of the process. Noel claims, though, that the technology won’t mean a reduction in actual lawyers for the company.Nowadays, as the distributed ledger gains in prominence within a range of industries and varying use cases, industries are realizing the benefits that it can provide. So much so, that law firms are experimenting with the technology to determine its impact on manual processes that they currently perform.Following the success of different ICOs of many Crypto CurrenciesThe Billionaire Mark Cuban on Bloomberg announces the extreme investments this year of how much money being invested in supporting the Blockchain Technology.Watch the video throughout to be in touch with the Crypto Industry and its huge growth.Wixlar Group is so proud to provide its unique services and extraordinary applications for its customers that would raise the performance and the creativity of the cryptocurrencies’ markets.Start using Wixlar Today!Wixlar offers its customers on the beta testing mode, the ability to buy the tickets of the Events using Wixlar Coins.

Proof of work succeed in that by substituting a formal barrier to participation, such as each single node power in the verifying process is depending on the computing power that the node brings.After that, problem of huge power and electricity fees began to appear in order to continue working with the proof of work which led to a new alternative approach called proof of stake that is calculating the weight of a node according to its currency staking or holding only which means more power and electricity saving. The discussion showing the benefits of the two approaches proof of work and proof of stake and both approaches can be used for any cryptocurrency.Each Transaction is being placed using a wallet (web wallet, Windows wallet, APPLE Wallet, Mobile Wallet) as a block in the blockchain in order to be verified or voted among the nodes in the network, that is the Miners work in the Proof of Work and Stakers work in the Proof of stake.Transactions can be processed in less time according to many people who are interested in mining and staking and allowing themselves to become a verifying node in the network to gain some profit which makes the network alive as long as there are active nodes in the network. Anyone can check the blockchain and the number of blocks processed through the blockexplorer but for security reasons, no one can know the exact owner or receiver of any transactions which provides privacy and anonymity for network users.BitCoin and Crypto ConceptsIntroduction to BitCoin and Crypto Currencies ConceptsThe Decentralized Digital Currency Concept has been under study for decades where there might be no authority in the middle of transactions.BitCoin as the first cryptocurrency succeed to provide anonymous transactions without exposing the identity of the sender or receiver which led to a real practical way to provide security to users and anonymity control across the Globe. Crypto Currencies came to life after huge efforts through continuous researchesHistory of CryptoCurrenciesThe anonymous 1980s and 1990s electronic cash protocols were mostly dependable on a crypt-graphic primitive called Chaumian Blinding that provided new currencies with privacy control, however, their underlying protocols failed to gain attraction because they were depending on a Centralized Authority.In 1998, Wei Dai’s b-money succeed to become the first proposal to introduce an innovation idea depending on creating money through solving computational puzzles and Decentralized, however that proposal did not show actually how a decentralized environment can be implemented.In 2005, Hal Finney introduced a new concept of “reusable proofs of work” which is a whole system uses combined ideas from b-money and Adam Back’s computationally Hashcash puzzles in order to create a new concept for CryptoCurrency, however it failed shortly because it relied on trusted computing mechanism as a backend.In 2009, BitCoin as the first decentralized currency was implemented in practice by Satoshi Nakamoto that combined primitives to manage ownership of BitCoins through public key cryptography with a hashing algorithm in order to keep a track or blockchain of who owns coins, known as “proof of work.”Proof of StakeProof of Work POW and Proof of Stake POSEach system has its own pros and cons, each cryptocurrency’s owners choose whether to use POW or POS or even Hybrid POW/POS that uses proof of work in the beginning of the coins until specific number of coins is mined then the system will be converted automatically to proof of stake where miners are becoming stakers that stake or hold coins in their wallets in order to vote or verify on transactions.Wixlar A Future Technology in Crypto Currencies Transactions, Portable Wallets and Decentralized ApplicationsAfter twelve years of experience in business trades with global companies and seven years of cryptocurrency research, Wixlar Group Co.
