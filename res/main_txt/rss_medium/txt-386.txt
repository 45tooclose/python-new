Tenno’s directionWe want to be more than just another payment application that converts crypto to fiat. We want to be the payment company that helps cryptocurrency to be accepted everywhere around the world and not even having to convert it to fiat.How to get more stores to accept crytocurrency?To get everyone on board with crypto we need to make it easy for people that are not sure what it is or what to do with it to accept it. Or at least turn it into something they understand. And these transitions need to be as easy as possible.That is what we are working on with the Tenno checkout payment form. Trying to making it as easy to setup as possible. Shoppers pay in crypto and merchants get fiat. This allows early adopters (Yes, I still think we are early adopter.) to spend their crypto without merchants having to wonder how to get cash once they accept the payment.Where should we start?The best place to growing the cryptocurrency payment space (in our opinion) is exactly where cryptocurrency all started online. There is less friction there. No, paper receipts or hardware to put in place just code. And it’s a lot easy for a person from France to find a UK website that sells a product in exchange for crypto that will ship to them. Than it is to find a store somewhere in Europe that accepts crypto and go there and pay with your phone. (we know there are cryptocurrency credit cards which can be used the same way as traditional credit cards; but we want to do it a bit different).Where do we go from there?We keep building systems to facilitate and push the acceptance of crypto everywhere all while spreading the word. And let people know that it’s more than just an asset class, but it’s an actual currency that has the capacity to replace the fiat currencies we use today if all the right systems are in place.ThanksThanks for reading.
