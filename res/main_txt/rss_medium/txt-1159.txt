Introducing Salto: your bank’s smart friendThere are things in life that we do not learn at school but are actually essential throughout our life. One of them is personal finances.We have unanswered questions: Can I afford this phone? Am I saving enough for my vacation trip? Will I have enough money at the end of the month? Should I invest part of my savings? And, if so, how much and how should I do it? These questions come to mind, and not having a clear answer makes us make wrong decisions and have no peace of mind about our capital.
