Bitrust- Making Investing easy.BITRUST is an affordable, decentralized, easy to use peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency insurance marketplace that is based on Ethereum, a blockchain-leveraging smart-contract technology. The objective of BITRUST is to be affordable for retail digital currency investors with an average monthly trading volume of between $100 and $100,000.Blockchain technology is constantly developing and the cryptocurrency market is growing and we couldn’t be more happy about it. This represents not only a significant technology breakthrough in data architecture and in terms of security providing distributive or decentralized networks, but we also get the feeling that a major movement is happening globally. BITRUST aims to promote the even greater involvement of blockchain technology in our daily lives by reducing the risks associated with investments in cryptocurrency, thereby allowing new and existing projects to flourish for the benefit of the entire system.WorkingTypically, peer-to-peer networks involve two or more parties. Bitrust, being a p2p network, usually engages two or parties in its smart contracts. These parties are the buyers and the sellers.The Ethereum smart contract requires consent from both parties before a contact is implemented. In this regard, both sides have to lock their funds before a transaction is validated. The funds are temporarily held in the form of either BITRUST Tokens (BTF) or any other permitted digital currency. Once the insurance period expires, the system automatically executes the smart contract. This process eliminates the possibility of fraudFeaturesDecentralizedThe foundation of BITRUST cryptocurrency insurance platform is a decentralised exchange and transaction clearing system which eliminates possible fraud and single-point-of-failure risks and prevents the system from external regulation.AnonymousBITRUST does not ask you for any personal data because we believe that your opportunity to manage your own assets and trade should not be affected by who you are.Intuitive and easy to use UIThe user interface of BITRUST cryptocurrency insurance platform is one of the simplest and user-friendly you’ve ever seen in the cryptoworld. It was our priority from the start to make our product as easy and as intuitive as possible for our users.

The entire transaction within BITRUST requires both parties — the buyer of insurance and the seller of insurance — to lock their funds in BITRUST tokens (BTF) or a certain set of other cryptocurrencies as permitted by our platform. After the insurance contract date expires (as pre-agreed by both parties) and based on the conditions provided, the BITRUST smart contract is executed in a decentralized and automated way — ensuring the agreed terms are carried out. This mechanism eliminates the possibility of fraudulent behavior by any of the parties involved, e. g. not delivering on the promise (payment) in case the “bet” did not go in their favor.BITRUST tokensThe Ethereum ecosystem allows for the deployment of Turing-complete trustless smart contracts on top of its blockchain. This flexibility and extensibility has made the ERC20 token interface the most frequently-used token issuance standard.Ethereum-based tokens rely on a well-established Ethereum infrastructure that benefits from several features:1 Security and predictability (as opposed to, for example, having to run an independent blockchain network).2 Use of robust and well-supported clients (Ethereum-based tokens can be managed with official Ethereum clients).3 High liquidity (interchangeable with other Ethereum-based tokens or Ether), means easier listing on exchanges with existing infrastructure.Roadmap:Team· Alex Duhamel CEOAlex’s core expertise is in derivative functionalities and hedging strategies used in various forms of insurance against asset depreciation.· Elina Krumina CFOElina has a long record of accomplishment in various banking sectors.
