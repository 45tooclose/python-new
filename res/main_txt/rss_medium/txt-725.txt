Ms. VanLandingham complied with the requests and falsely stated in firm records that she verbally contacted the client regarding the transfers, when, she did not. VanLandingham also allegedly sold shares of four securities in the client’s account without authorization, in order to fund the account for the wire transfer. This is against securities laws and internal firm rules.Heather VanLandingham, according to her online, FINRA BrokerCheck report, was previously registered with Morgan Stanley in Palm Harbor, Florida from July 2013 until February 2016, and SunTrust Investment Services in Riverview, Florida from April 2016 until February 2018.
