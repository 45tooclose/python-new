QuarkChain — ICO ReviewVision?: A High Capacity peer-to-peer transactional systemSummary: QuarkChain is an innovative permissionless blockchain architecture that aims to meet the global-wise commercial standard. It provides a secure, decentralized, and scalable blockchain solution to deliver high on-chain transaction per second. The main features of QuarkChain are:Reshardable two-layered blockchainGuaranteed security by market-driven collaborative miningAnti-centralized horizontal scalabilityEfficient cross-shard transactionsSimple account management“QuarkChain is a high-throughput blockchain that aims to achieve millions of transactions per second (TPS). The high-capacity system will solve the scalability problem that current main blockchains are facing.”Team & Advisors ⭐- 9.5/10The QuarkChain core team has years of development experience and deep technical skills. Qi Zhou, PhD is an expert in high performance systems. He is a former Googler with 15+ years of development experience.Zhaoguang Wang is an expert in large scale distributed systems with 6 years work experience at Facebook and Google.Xiaoli Ma is a Professor at GeogiaTech and an IEEE fellow.The advisors for the QuarkChain project include experts in the field of cyber security, cloud data services and blockchain investing and have years of experience in international companies like IBM and Sun Microsystems.Roadmap ⛳- 9.5/10QuarkChain recently built a test net which can achieve 2000+ tx per second.Q1, 2018: Whitepaper and Proof of ConceptQ2, 2018: Release of Testnet 0.1 with in-shard & cross-shard transaction capabilityQ3, 2018: Release of Testnet 0.2 with support for smart contractsQ4, 2018: Release of Mainnet 1.0Q1, 2019: Release of Mainnet 2.0Token Metrics — 9/10Total Hardcap: $20MTotal tokens: 10,000,000,000 tokensICO Token sale %: 20%ICO Token price: 1 ETH = 31533 QKC (Private sale bonus: 25%)CompetitorsQuarkChain will compete directly with high throughput blockchains like Ziliqa and 0Chain. It already has a test net which has been launched internally and is definitely ahead of some of its major competitors.Verdict — 91% ?QuarkChain is trying to solve one of the most important issues facing blockchains today ie. achieving scalability, security and decentralization without compromising any of these three. It is way ahead of some of its competitors by already having a testnet capable of doing 2000+ tx per second and is aiming to reach 100,000 to 1M tx per second. Considering the super star team and the really low hard cap of $20M, we are extremely bullish on this project.
