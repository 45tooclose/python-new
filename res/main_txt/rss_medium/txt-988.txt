IPCHAIN Database Announces Rebrand to VaultitudeIPCORP Ltd. has announced that its Blockchain powered software for intellectual property (IP) protection will be rebranded to Vaultitude. The new brand will help to firmly establish the innovative platform as an indispensable tool in the arsenal of innovators looking to protect their creations and serves as an opportunity to remain unique in the marketplace.“The last months we have been in close contact with leading players in the IP industry and they all agree that our platform has tremendous potential to overcome existing difficulties. We felt that our unique approach, tailored specifically to the needs of inventors, scientists, artists and companies, required us to rethink not just our name, but our entire brand and focus on the core functionalities of our software”, said Dominik Thor, CEO.Vaultitude is being developed following WIPO guidelines and with the support of leading authorities, stakeholders, universities and research organizations. It reduces the inherent complexity of IP protection, provides users with a clear overview of their IP and allows to solve previously complex issues. The platform for holistic IP protection encourages the user to safeguard all of their creations (such as inventions, designs, scientific findings, artistic works, code or trade secrets) with to a safe digital vault, a central feature of Vaultitude. Further, the user will be able, thanks to immutable Blockchain technology to easily and safely acquire proof of his/her authorship for the practical application of copyrights, make defensive publications, share confidential information, sell or license his work or get in touch with IP professionals to successfully file patents and trademarks.The team behind Vaultitude is currently preparing a major update of the project’s website, that will include not only the rebranding but also the release of a fully functional demo of the software. This information and the demo will be available by mid of May.For more information please visit www.vaultitude.com or www.ipchaindatabase.com
