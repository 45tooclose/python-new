That currency is Olympic Coin.As their whitepaper announces, “Olympic coin is the Athletes’ coin”. So far, so good, but it goes beyond that. The coin is meant to reward those athletes who won during the Olympic games that were celebrated this year (2018). Also, the coin, that uses OLMP as its ticker, will be used to purchase sport garments and accessories. The final goal is to make OLMP the coin used by athletes for payments.Olympic coin uses proof-of-stake (PoS) and masternodes as the methods to reward coin holders. PoS is not only energy-efficient, but also a powerful way to secure the network of a coin that uses the blockchain. In order to run an OLMP masternode, the investors needs a collateral of 1500 OLMP.Learn more about Olympic:- Website: https://olympiccoin.cash - Whitepaper: https://olympiccoin.cash/files/Whitepaper%20Olympic.pdf- Bitcointalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2994671- Discord: https://discord.gg/uAqMFRR- Telegram: https://t.me/olympic_main- Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1P6bttXcMMxYy6c9bpcupwWallets:- Windows: https://olympiccoin.cash/files/Olympic-qt.exe- Linux: https://olympiccoin.cash/files/Olympic-qt- GitHub and Guides for MNs: https://github.com/OlympicCoin/olympic- Explorer: https://explorer.olympiccoin.cash/Exchanges:- CryptoBridge: https://wallet.crypto-bridge.org/market/BRIDGE.OLMP_BRIDGE.BTC
