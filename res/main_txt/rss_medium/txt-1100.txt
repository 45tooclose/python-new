South African largest exchange added support of Monero coin (XMR)Last friday, April 27th, one of the biggest South African exchanges — ICE³X added support of the Monero (XMR) coin. Firstly, pair XMR/BTC was added and now there is also XMR/ZAR pair, what means that exchange users can now cash out their cryptocurrency with quite good rate.For last week exchange rate for XMR/ZAR almost 50% growth, achieving its’ peak on April 25th with 1 to 3684 rate (XMR/ZAR respectively).ICE³X is the first and only cryptocurrency exchange in South Africa to support and list the Monero token, which currently includes XMR/ZAR & XMR/BTC markets.“We think Monero is currently the most suitable coin to add to the exchange, because it is fundamentally different from bitcoin, has a real-world use case and somehow managed to stay more true to the “original idea” around which Bitcoin was created. We continuously improve on balancing our users’ needs with a safe and secure trading environment, and the addition of XMR has been on our roadmap for a while now and we are keen to see the market response.”, — Gareth Grobler, CEO of ICE³X
