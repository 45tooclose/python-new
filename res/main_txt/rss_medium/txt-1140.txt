I heard bonus is served also for participants during this period.MVL Ecosystem, pronounced as “em-buh l” Ecosystem ~ is a new blockchain-based ecosystem created for use in the vehicle industry.So basically the MVL Ecosystem is participated by individuals familiar with the vehicle industry — for example, car owners, motor vehicle manufacturers/retailers, motor vehicle repair and/or modification service providers, motor vehicle insurance companies — and their participation in the ecosystem will allow them to upload core data relating to a specific car, including information regarding traffic accidents or repairs, into the blockchain.Participants who provides data related to the car will received MVLpoints (MVP) that serves as a reward system of course to encourage contributors to the system.MVL Points can be traded for MVL (and vice versa) or used to trade cash with other participants in the ecosystem. This also means that contributors will earn MVL Coins if their data is sold by providing data to others.MISSIONAll vehicle-related services connected in one ecosystemValue safe driving and good serviceVehicle data on the blockchain brings various benefitToken Details for PRE-ICO1st Pre-ICO : 21:00, 26th April 2018–21:00, 2nd May 2018 (UTC+9) (+25% Bonus)ICO TOKEN SALE2nd Pre-ICO : 21:00, 3rd May 2018–21:00, 11th May 2018 (UTC+9)  (+15% Bonus, +20% in the first 48H)Main-ICO : 21:00, 15th May 2018–21:00, 24th May 2018 (UTC+9) (+5% in the first 48H)MVL Integrated Wallet Solution, this app will be introduced in the early stages before the MVL mainnet is ready.Participants can get a MVL wallet to keep coins and exchange them.
