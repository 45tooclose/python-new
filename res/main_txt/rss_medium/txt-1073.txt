Streaming Payments and the Future of InteroperabilityTalk given by Evan SchwartzEvan Schwartz is the co-inventor of the Interledger Protocol. He spoke on Day 2 of the MIT Bitcoin Expo.Websites have multiple different payment methodsCommon Question — Do you have Venmo? → Are we on the same payment network?Payments at their core are disconnected.banks !=<> blockchain !=<> mobile moneyArchitecture of the Internethourglass architectureFundamentally disconnected → the Internet Protocol (routing layer) connects the various networks (Wifi, Bluetooth, Ethernet) to the transport layer, then to the application layerInterledger Protocol (ILP)Applying the Internet’s design to enable streaming payments across every payment networkArchitecture of Interledgersimilar to Internet architectureBottom layer = systems of value = blockchains, banks, payment channels. Interledger connects various ledgers to the transport layer, then to the application layerWhat ILP can do? Enable streaming paymentsSubscription modelsAt their core bundle up payments — its easy, convenientPeople with low usage ($$ more per use of service) are paying for people with high usage ($$ less per use of service)In reality subscription models are profiting off the discrepancy of people with high usage and people with low usagePay per use*user experience needs to be good* for pay per use servicesWhen money is sent from network to network → really ILP packets are sent that create obligations which are settled afterwardsSimple payment channel updatePerson A sends Person B the packet through a connectorPerson B gives Person A the pre-imagePerson A signs a payment channel updateInterledger spun out of RippleWhat can you do?ILP Boston Community Meetup — https://www.meetup.com/Boston-Interledger/Video Link — https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaNi1Blw6V0If you liked what you read, give us a few claps ??? maybe 50 if you’d like ❤️❤️❤️ Follow @MITBitcoinClub and @gosathya on Twitter.
