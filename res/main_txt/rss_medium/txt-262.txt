Rublix Development Update — April 18, 2018Hedge Prototype 1.0 is NearWe are hard at work at Rublix and continue to push forward with the development of the Hedge platform which we have test deployed on the POA Network.Due to scaling limitations within the Ethereum ecosystem, we have chosen to work with our friends at POA Network to test deploy the initial “Hedge” prototype on their network. Here are a few highlights of this release:This version utilizes Oraclize and the Crypto-Compare API to gather market dataThe pricing parameters are coded into the smart contract and will be verified once per dayA few last refinements remain before we release this version to the community however, the code is on our GitHub if you’d like to test deploy it on their networkWe are excited to finalize this initial prototype of Hedge and conduct further testing and collect feedback.For more in-depth information and functions of the POA Network you can visit their website here. POA Network has proven to be a scalable solution for Ethereum DApps and we recommend the platform to anyone who wants to deploy more complex DApps at a lower cost.Hedge Prototype 2.0Since the RBLX token was originally minted on the Ethereum network, we have managed to solve our scaling issues by handling the majority of functions off chain. Our team is pursuing development using state-channels on the Ethereum network and a trusted Oracle which is maintained by Rublix.Our rationale for releasing multiple prototype versions is so that we have an idea of how our platform performs on different environments. We want to ensure we are constructing on the most optimally structured platform to suit our needs.Seeking International ConferencesWe are on the lookout for the next conferences where we can share our ideas with the world!After attending conferences in Los Angeles, New York, Miami, Mexico, Singapore and most recently Hong Kong, the Rublix team is looking to spread the word at the next international stage.We want to get the Rublix community involved in choosing where we should travel to next!
