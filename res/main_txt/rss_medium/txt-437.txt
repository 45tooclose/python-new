Liftoff!Leonardo Render officially launches, commencing a new era in CGI renderingLeft to right: Head of Strategy, Delon Demetz, CEO, Marco IodiceIn the jeweled desert metropolis of Dubai last week, the Leonardo Render project officially moved from stealth to public at the World Blockchain Forum. After several years of development, the team launched the proprietary Leonardo Render platform at an exclusive dinner at the five star, Five Palm Jumeirah Hotel.Head of Strategy, Delon de Metz, gave an intricate presentation on the scope of the Leonardo Render solution:“What Leonardo [Render] offers to the industry is what I find so exciting. CGI isn’t just about video games and animated films — it is a core technology in a huge amount of industries, including everything from architecture to product development. The delays creators face is astonishing — sometimes it takes over a month to render a single second of animation, while a static image might take 24 hours. Leonardo offers to provide vastly higher speeds at near real time, and deliver them at a lower cost.”CEO, Marco IodiceThe following day, on the main stage at the World Blockchain Forum, CEO, Marco Iodice, delved deep into the market opportunities embodied in Leonardo Render:“We’re entering the market at the ideal time. The prior-to-now dominant GPU crypto miners are freshly superseded by new mining-dedicated ASIC chips. Leonardo Render offers huge opportunities to the players at both ends of the rendering equation — the image creator and the miner. The CGI industry is expected to bloom into a $150BN industry in the next two years, and for GPU crypto miners the potential earnings from rendering CGI versus mining Ethereum is an improvement of 1,752%. It’s an upside that really speaks to the outstanding opportunity of this technology.”The Leonardo Render private sale is underway.
