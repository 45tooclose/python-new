Altcoins for Investing in 2018What are altcoins?Altcoins are alternative cryptocurrencies to Bitcoin. There are thousands of altcoins in existence, some are startup projects and others are well established with large market caps. Each altcoin still applies blockchain technology as an open source digital ledger for transactions, but for a variety of purposes. Some altcoins are used as currency, like Bitcoin, while others act as utility tokens that are used as a means to access a platform’s products or services. It is from the perceived value of a platform’s products and services from which altcoins derive their value, which is why investors seek out projects with the most potential in hopes of making a larger profit.Below is a list of altcoins which I believe have the most potential to deliver a high return on investment in 2018.Premium-TierEOS (EOS) — EOS is a platform for developing decentralized blockchain applications (Dapps). It is similar to Ethereum in function but also aims to have the security of Bitcoin. They also claim to possess massive scalability, citing that they can process millions of transactions per second. The current price for EOS is $9.Breaking-out-TierArcBlock (ABT) — ArcBlock is another platform for building and deploying DApps. It is built on Blockchain 3.0, and ArcBlock aims to compete with the likes of Ethereum and EOS. Arcblock token (ABT) is the utility token that will be used to pay for services on the platform. ABT is currently valued at $0.95 and climbing.New-TierBitMart (BMX) — BMX is a utility token for BitMart, a new digital asset exchange platform which launched in March. BMX is similar to BNB from Binance and has the same repurchase mechanism which will ultimately drive its value as its supply decrease. Thus, investors have the potential to see the same gains as the early adopters of BNB.Disclaimer: These are my personal opinions and therefore, they are not financial advice.
