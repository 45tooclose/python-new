How to install EOS on WindowsAs a software developer and a closet hippie with a passion for Blockchain and making the world a better place, the vision of EOS and Dan Larimer really speaks to me. So in order for me to learn more about EOS on a technical level and understand how to develop smart contracts on the platform with minimum fuss I needed to get EOS up and running on my Windows 10 PC.Step 1: Enable Windows Subsystem for LinuxRun PowerShell as an administrator and type the following command.Click Yes to any prompts that appear.Restart your computer when prompted.Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-LinuxStep 2: Enable Developer Mode in windows“Code on a computer” by Markus Spiske on UnsplashHit Windows key and type settings to open the settings app.Click Update & Security.Click For Developers from the left hand navigation.Click the Developer Mode radio button.Step 3: Install Ubuntu on WindowsGo to the following URL follow the instructions to install ubuntu. https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6As part of the install you will be required to create a username and password. Make a note of these and keep them somewhere safe.Ensure Ubuntu is fully up to date by typing the following in the bash command line interface. (You will probably have a window open already but if not hit the windows key and type Ubuntu)sudo apt updatesudo apt full-upgradeThe end result will be similar to the screenshot below. Mine was already up to date but yours will probably have more output the first time you run it.Updating Ubuntu on Windows 104. Install cmake and gitWhile still in Bash run the following commands to install cmake and git. Enter your password when prompted.sudo apt install cmakesudo apt install gitStep 4: Clone and Build EOSCreate a Workspace on your PC where EOS will be installed. I created mine at C:\Workspaces\EOS. For reference this maps to /mnt/c/Workspaces/EOS on the linux filesystem as you will see in some of the commands below.Clone the EOS source code from the Github repo.cd /mnt/c/Workspaces/EOSgit clone https://github.com/eosio/eos --recursive3. Compile EOS. This can take some time so leave it running in the background but keep an eye on it as you will occasionally be asked for your password.cd /mnt/c/Workspaces/EOS/eos./eosio_build.sh ubuntu fullNote: My install took over an hour and failed near the end. I simply ran the above command again and it completed successfully the second time.4. Launch an EOS node by running the following command.cd /mnt/c/Workspaces/EOS/eos/build/programs/nodeos && ./nodeos -e -p eosio --plugin eosio::wallet_api_plugin --plugin eosio::chain_api_plugin --plugin eosio::account_history_api_pluginIf this is successful you will see blocks being produced by a single block producer named eosio in the output window.Eosio block production on a single node testnetThat is all for the basic setup and installation of EOS on your local windows 10 machine. In future posts we will explore the primary components of EOS; nodeos, cleos, and keosd. Then I hope to move onto learning how to write smart contracts in the EOS ecosystem. Stay tuned if you want to learn EOS along with me.
