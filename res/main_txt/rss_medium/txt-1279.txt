Diary of a (sometimes wimpy) co-founder (Pt 2)So far this week has been both successful and daunting, with just over 7 weeks to go until pre-ico it is all hands to the pumps. We are trying to build our community through social media and other marketing funnels but its hard work.The question runs through my head constantly, have we left enough time?There are so many plates to spin, Marketing, Business Docs, Community, Building a Team, Securing Investments, Leadership, Advisors etc etc etc but I wouldn’t change it for anything else in the world.Partnering, Partnering, Partnering — why do it alone? We are pursuing some possibilities of joint marketing with another ICO and also sharing skills with some guys and girls in Mayfair — exciting times! If you would like to have a chat about a possible partnership drop me a line.Made contact with some great friends that I haven’t seen for 15 years and found a common interest in the crypto world. Made some great new friends and associates in the crypto world as well.Another great week and I can’t wait for another…..
