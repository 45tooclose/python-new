Photochain killing it at the Blockchain Summit in Crypto Valley!Photochain team (Left to right): Haris, Fredi, Stanislav, RalfLast Wednesday and Thursday some of the best and brightest minds in blockchain descended onto Crypto Valley in the beautiful lakeside town of Zug, Switzerland.When we say best and brightest, you can count that Photochain were there — invited on behalf of hosts, Lakeside Partners. We had a VIP booth where we could discuss all things Photochain with investors and interested followers alike.Ralf and Stanislav enjoying a productive chatAnd boy did we have a lot of productive discussions! We lost count of the number of individuals who started their conversation with “Photochain is by far the most understandable use case here” or “Photochain is actually a needed blockchain business” or “Photochain is such a straightforward use case — you don’t even need to know anything about blockchain to understand it!”As a result, we come back from two exhausting, yet highly productive days with plenty of leads to follow up with, and deals to be negotiated and closed. Investors and attentive onlookers from all corners of the globe believe Photochain has everything it needs to achieve our stated ambition — to take 10% of the $4 billion annual revenue stock photography market by 2020!Haris taking a photo on our Photochain photo booth with a high profile gentleman from South KoreaIt was a shame it had to end, but it was great increase our community with more high profile investors and crypto people. And we’ll be back on the road soon — hopefully at a crypto event near you!You can find our video summary of the Summit here, with CEO Stanislav and CMO Haris commenting on the end of two action packed days.Our ICO is live and available at ico.photochain.io
