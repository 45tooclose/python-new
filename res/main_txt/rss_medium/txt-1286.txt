Luna Capital’s focus on scalability and growth of blockchain for businesses that are scalable aligned well with the crypto focused group panel discussion. They had their thoughts on NEMs scalability and the potential of EventChain as a mainstream business use case of the blockchain.The consensus among the panelists determined the huge need for scalable platforms that will be able to withstand the growing demand of businesses to integrate blockchain technology and transactions into their operations in the coming years. NEM also discussed the need for interoperability, and highlighted the communication between NEM public blockchain and NEM Private blockchains, which can handle business transactions easier. Recently Pundi X, a non-arm’s reach partner of EventChain, implemented the NEM blockchain into their POS devices would which have the current capability of transacting much faster than the Ethereum Blockchain.As we’ve been developing the EventChain SmartTickets application we’ve been considering the business needs of the blockchain specifically for high frequency ticket sales, and the necessary scalability needs of the underlying technology to support ticketing at its peak.
