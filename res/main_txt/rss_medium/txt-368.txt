A crypto-trader’s diary — week 4I’ve been toying with two threads of thought since week 3:My confidence in bitcoin as a long term investment is growing stronger.I’ve decided that I want to prove to myself the validity of various indicators and patterns.So I guess I’m a mix of optimistic and sceptical, much like I am about my life in general.Bitcoin as a long-term thingA small part of my increased optimism this week came from hearing that a dude called Tim Draper (not the famous curtain magnate) predicts that bitcoin will hit $250,000 by 2022.Now, I’m not a sucker, and first predictions ain’t worth the tweet they’re written in, but this is a chap who — way back in 2014 — predicted bitcoin would hit $10,000 in 2017 (at the time, when it was only a few hundred bucks, that must have seemed as silly as a quarter-million does today).I extended one of the charts that I made last week to see what a journey to a $250,000 would look like.This is the chart that plots the start, high, and low of each of the six big bubbles, extended out to a quarter-mil by the end of 2022.6% month-on-month increaseThis is wildly speculative (on my part, Tim probably thought about it intelligently), but there’s nothing outrageous about that chart. On the face of it, there’s nothing wrong with the way that line has been extended.Here’s my plan that will probably morph into something else…I reckon I’ve got about $1,000 a month that I don’t really need (it’s just wasted on things like charity and paying off my home loan at the moment). I’d be happy to throw this money into bitcoin for the long term (many years).Assuming that each month the value of bitcoin increases by 6% and I buy another thousand bucks worth of bitcoin, that ought to grow to a shade over $600,000 in a smidge under 4 years.And here’s an interesting thing, by the end of this chart I would have 1.75 bitcoins (not a typo). And if things proceeded consistently through to the end of 2025, I would have 1.78 bitcoins (and 7.2 million dollars).Maths is weird (as is dollar cost averaging).Of course, this is all childish make believe, but at least I’ve got an idea in my head. If I put away $1,000/month I’m not going to be retiring on the returns any time soon (and I still have to get up and go to work tomorrow) but if all goes according to plan I’ll have a nice comfy pile of money.OK that’s enough dreaming, on to something a bit more down to earth.Support and resistanceI started my week by resetting my assumption that support and resistance lines were useful. If they are never useful as a way to select buy and sell points, then I can get way ahead of the curve by knowing that I can ignore them.But if they’re a useful tool, then it shouldn’t be difficult for me to find plenty of examples in bitcoin’s history that demonstrate their ability to predict upcoming price movements.What I foundIt took me all of 5 minutes to come across a pretty clear example of support and resistance lines:What’s wrong with you chart?You can see the price bumping up and down between the ranges before ‘breaking out’, but then settling back into a range a little while later.I made this chart by randomly generating some numbers in Excel like so:I had to regenerate the random numbers three times before they created a chart where my stupid, excitable mind yelled “hey, there’s some support and resistance lines!”.I made this chart so that I can remind myself that my caveman brain really wants to see patterns where they don’t exist. And that my big ol’ lump of head meat is especially keen to see patterns when they can be backed up with some armchair crowd psychology.I even 2D printed the chart and hung it on me wall. I will refer to it any time I think I’ve seen a support or resistance line in the bitcoin chart — to keep myself in check.
