Ending the Manipulation SagaHello,I’m writing a message to tie all of this nonsense together once and for all and move forward. With everyone hopefully.There will more than likely be a divergence of opinions on this article, and I more than welcome it. That’s all a part of the process.IntroductionYesterday (April 26th, 2018), I received anonymous correspondence from an individual on Twitter (shell account) that had apparently wedged themselves among the inner circle of those that were discussed in that STEEMIT post that I published on the 25th.Mind you, if you look at that article, I took the screenshots at 5:30 a.m. approximately. As I noted in my original article, I knew that they would see me come into the chat and would more than likely suspect that I was in there to ‘blow’ their cover.See below:I bring up this screenshot for a few reasons:There’s nothing nefarious about this conversation, in itself. However, it does exonerate my name in a few ways because it shows:They knew well in advance of the article that I published on Steemit (this conversation occurred about 9 hours before) that this would be a major problem in their eyes. So the assertion that anyone had no idea what they were doing or that it was wrong in any way, has been debunked.The individuals that joined this additional chat were also on the ‘inside’. Note the nature of the language — ‘Who invited med [me] in?’This is why I’ve hesitated to ‘exonerate’ individuals in the chat that claim that they have ‘done nothing’. However, I have clarified things considerably at the end of this article.Another reason why I’ve refused to exonerate individuals that claim that they’ve done nothing is this:The presence of Cryptotrooper and The Crypto Dog stand out to me in these additional screenshots because they are two individuals that asserted before that they had nothing to do with anything going on and that they were merely bystanders.However, being in this third chat — which was created approximately 9 hours beforehand — provides more than enough evidence, in my opinion, that they were fully aware that this was wrong and they could have come forth before I did to denounce the activities going on.However, neither of them did.I took a lot of flack for including them within the screenshots among others. However, in light of this information, I feel that their inclusion within was justified.Especially in light of messages that I received from some like this:Now, it appears to me that some of those that were in the group viewed the screenshots, and upon seeing that there was no actual contribution from them included within, decided to take advantage of that fact to try to assert that they “just happened” to be in the chat (I’m not applying this to DannyLes3, see below).These statements sound very disingenuous when considering that these same people were actively involved in the subsequent conversations (again, before I ever posted anything).Also, what’s troubling is that the original invite link was not to a public group.So, the individuals that joined that second chat, had to join through the link specifically.Here are the remaining screenshots that I received of the Telegram discourse:Take note of the conversations on the left panel and the names presented within. This screenshot indicates a time that’s roughly around the time of the story’s release.This was posted AFTER I released the storyHere is a list of all the individuals that had joined this subsequent chatPerhaps what’s most troubling is the fact that a separate Discord group was created from the Telegram group in which an invite link was handed out.I can’t confirm anything about the identities of the individuals in there other than the usernames. Everyone is free to make their own judgments as to what is going on in there.I was also sent video of the conversations within this Discord, which also featured conversations from the Telegram as well. The individual that sent me this, whom was adamant about maintaining their anonymity, also put up other screenshots that corroborate with what was in the video as well.This is what made this ‘tip’ legitimate, in my opinion, because of the timing (I received this information less than 24 hours from the time that the story broke) and the fact that the actual timestamps match up with the order of events and what individuals are saying (I observed Gat leaving the chat around 6:00 a.m. ish).Here is a correspondence I had with a friend of mine (unrelated) at the time, shortly after I had joined the chat and learned the information contianed within:Name redacted for their safety/confidentialitySo, as you can see from the screenshots above, in the conversation that I had with an unrelated friend — I observed that they were leaving the chat early that morning as well around that same time frame (me relaying the news to my friend about their departure was delayed because I wasn’t looking at the group to receive those notifications).This is another HUGE reason that I believe the screenshots to be legitimate and not ‘photoshopped’.Also, in terms of the Twitter user that goes by the handle of ‘JewKorean’, here are a few things that I will acknowledge:He is not definitively seen in any of the chats.The initial screenshots I took of the conversation log and subsequent Google documents did not have his name on it.This new log does have his name on it.Let’s take a closer look here:People are right to note that his alleged contribution in this spreadsheet would make the ‘Total Value’ (in the red box) wholly inaccurate.However, in Google Sheets, it typically works a bit different than in regular Excel. In order to do the ‘value add’ function, you actually have to select the blocks themselves rather than inputting a formula:Thus, if someone’s information were added into space 10, then the sum would not also add their total.That’s assuming that this was done.Once again, it is worth noting that there is no other evidence (that I’m aware of ), that JewKorean participated in this, asked for their name to be included within, etc. There is also no conversation within any logs that I have seen where his name is mentioned by others.Thus, before the flood of ‘this is defamatory’ statements, come rushing. Please know that I have no clue whether he was involved or not or the true involvement of any of the other participants for that matter.Another point that is worth making is that the statements within the chat corroborate what I said in my response story:Pt. II — CryptoMedication’s Response to BravadoSo, earlier today, I put up a flood of screenshots regarding the nefarious activities of very popular promoters that…medium.comIf you remember, I stated this in the story:Now, look in the conversation that was captured:Notice the statement, “im guessing the beef started when dog calle dhim out for his fake followers on Twitter ?”Once again, notice the reference to a ‘beef’ before I ever posted a single thing. Also, notice that their reactions and immediate assumptions corroborate exactly what I stated in my follow-up response article (I received all of these screenshots after both articles were posted, for the record).So the claims that:I’m mentally unstableI’m emotionally unstableI was ‘angry about being kicked out of Bravado’and the other accusations that have been thrust my way by multiple parties, including CCN, have been proven to be demonstrably false at this point and these chat logs indicate as much.This, too, is yet another reason why I’m more than inclined to believe the veracity of these logs.What About the Videos?Yesterday, the anonymous contributor that sent me those above screenshots also published three videos.I saved the first two (which they later took off YouTube), as well as the third (which is currently on YouTube).The first two videos (which I am not posting at this moment because the user reported that they wanted to preserve their anonymity) show that the ‘Coin_Signals’ individual was sending out the Discord link to different individuals in the third chat.Here is the actual video that’s on YouTube currently:Ignore the troll face, it’s not a ‘fake’. I’m not sure why this is the default image for the video. The user alleges that they did not want their personal identity compromised, so they cut off the audio visual during the back half of the video. The audio, however, continues uninterrupted.Again, I cannot make any further assertions about the content of this video other than this is what was presented to me. It is up to you to decide what this means, what their statements mean, and what should/can be inferred from this.What I can say is that the information and evidence sent to me by this user heavily corroborates my own personal notes, observations and private statements made to individuals that had absolutely nothing to do with anything or anybody involved with the situation.So, the chances of this all being entirely fabricated, in my opinion — stands at zero.Additional Concerns:DannyLes3Over the past day or so, many folks have brought up DannyLes (apologies if I’m misspelling the name — I’m open to all corrections on that).I’m not sure if he deleted his Twitter with the DMs, but the gist of what he wanted me to convey is that he was just invited into the group and had no idea what was going on. He said that he was not there to participate, was unaware that he was added into the group and that he left soon after.The only remaining screenshot (which I sent to someone else that asked me to clear Danny’s name on his behalf) that I have from that conversation can be seen below:Before I got a chance to publish that article, Danny’s response had already been issued. However, I still would like to iterate his concerns and the fact that he was adamant about not being involved in accordance with the promise that I made to Danny.We know from the timing of the screenshots that I took (with him still being in there), that he did not leave immediately.However, that, in itself, does not mean that he was there to collaborate, cooperate, or contribute to the scheme at all.It is worth noting that DannyLes was not in this subsequent chat that was posted in full within this article. This, in my opinion, does give credence to his claim. Whether he was entirely oblivious or not is something I’m not qualified to state because I’m not in Danny’s head. But evidence does support the idea that he was not an active participant. At the very worst, one could possibly argue he was a passive bystander. I’m not saying that the latter is true, I’m just saying that, based on the evidence that I’m aware of and have posted, this is the worst conclusion that someone could come to about Danny regarding this situation.He also was not listed on the spreadsheet either at any point in time (either before or after). So, that gives much credence to his claims as well.The reason why I was unable too make this information public is because I was still gathering all information about this situation myself, and I did not want to misspeak about anyone’s involvement by either over or understating it.I acknowledge that Danny is married with kids as he stated in his Medium article yesterday and it was not my intent to defame Danny or ‘ruin’ him in any way as seen in the screenshots above.Bravado GroupAs you all know, there has been a back-and-forth sort of war between Bravado, their leaders, and CryptoMedication on Twitter. This has resulted in both parties asserting that there are defamatory statements that have been made against them.In light of what has been received, this can be said:There is no evidence, based on what I received, that provides indisputable or empirical proof that this was a collusion on the behalf of the BitcoinBravado organization.Many of the earlier claims that were stated in the initial pdf release by Bravado following this incident as well as on Twitter from their account and representatives, misrepresented their relationship with the individuals presented within the screenshots. This has already been shelled out in full on Twitter already (read my timeline for more information — @CryptoMedicated on Twitter)The names implicated within represent approximately half of the ‘executives’ within Bravado’s Discord group. So, while the argument cannot be made that the Bravado group was actively used as a tool or that the organization itself was involved in any of the collaborative efforts of the individuals presented within these screenshots from the stories that I have posted — it falls solely upon Bravado to fight any and all resulting incredulity from the general public. CryptoMedication is not responsible for any associations or claims that parties outside of or unaffiliated with CryptoMedication make.Stating that certain individuals that were depicted within the screenshots at the time of release were still actively affiliated with Bravado as far as the public knows (there was no press release or statement issued by the group before the release of the articles stating otherwise), it is not defamatory to state a large concentration of Bravado’s Executives (per their ranking in the Bravado Discord chat), appeared to be actively involved in colluding to wield their power to commit securities fraud.Regarding the Dog PoundOriginally, the article stated that the Dog Pound was involved. Similar to what was stated above about Bravado, there is no concrete evidence to suggest that the Dog Pound as an entity was involved.However, it is worth noting that the leader of the Dog Pound, was seen in every single chat, including the private Discord (see video).Thus, it is up to the general viewers to make their conclusions about how the leader of a group that recommends coins to its followers could also keep such backroom dealings (assuming they occurred or will occur), mutually exclusive from the group itself.In my personal opinion, this would be difficult — at best.Regarding CryptoGatIt’s worth noting that the original statements CryptoMedication made about Gat, in terms of his personality, stand. He is a nice individual.It’s not within my right to assign judgment over whether his apology was sincere or insincere. It is possible that, upon the release of all of the screenshots and the subsequent backlash, that Gat felt true remorse for his role in the alleged activities presented within the screenshots.In either case:This does not make Gat or anyone else involved an inherently ‘evil’ person.This does not mean that Gat has never done anything legitimately in his life.Although the evidence may seem to point to the contrary, it is hard to prove without a shadow of a doubt who was going to do what with what. In light of the screenshots, the intent seems pretty clear and most will probably come to the conclusion that, without interference, this plan more than likely would have executed itself (based on the lack of protest from anyone in the situation).Thus, Gat should not be receiving death threats or be berated around the clock. That was not the intent of this article. I don’t think that anyone of us have the authority to personally administer any ‘punishments’ to anyone.If this information has made people lose trust in CryptoGat, that’s more than fair. If you accept the apology and believe that Gat will not proceed with this behavior again, that’s fair as well.It’s up to the individual how they would like to carry this in light of what’s in the screenshots.CryptoMedicationThere has been much fuss about the identity of CryptoMedication or the intent behind this.Many of it, CryptoMedication has refrained from responding to because it possesses little relevance to the actual matter at hand.Some of the claims are so outrageous in nature that they are not worthy of being dignified with a response.CryptoCurrency CommunityThe cryptocurrency community at large has received this with mixed responses. Almost everyone has an opinion on the issue and the individuals involved.One thing that can be agreed on is that no one wants to follow or put their faith in any individuals that are collaborating on a mass scale to manipulate the price of certain coins, then ‘dump’ it on followers.It is in CryptoMedication’s sincerest hope that the outbreak of this story will push other traders/advice givers etc., in the space to elevate their quality of content and refrain from these practices. They aren’t needed.A Final Word For Those InvolvedThe individuals that are involved are brilliant within their own rights — each person within the chat.Although the way that these conversations were discovered reflect a general carelessness, which was not smart — the people themselves are better than that, and I know this.Despite whatever personal quarrels or issues we may have with each other, I know that these folks have the ability to deliver quality content to everyone in the space. I’ve talked to a few of them and I’ve seen their thoughts on issues and they are unique.These folks do learn legitimate information in the sphere, have learned to trade legitimately and do possess knowledge of things in the crypto space that would help newcomers. It is my personal hope that this will push them to do what they do best — which is provide quality information and content to individuals, charm people with their personalities, and continue to spread the good word of crypto to all those associated.Once again, viewing people through the 2-dimensional lens of ‘good’ or ‘evil’, is never helpful. We all make mistakes, and no one is perfect — myself included. I don’t think I’m ‘above’ the people in those screenshots, but I want a better culture in crypto.We don’t need to shill coins — there are plenty of ways for us to get money beyond that. It’s been shown that these folks have the ability to legitimately do technical/fundamental analysis and make money from it — in many cases, well in excess of what can be gained from any ‘manipulation’ plot and a lot less riskier as well.So, this is a call for the community to not simply ‘throw away’ these people or cast to them to the side as if they are forever evil or incapable of providing value. That’s not true. We just have to make sure as thought leaders in the crypto community that we’re more transparent with how we handle things, like stating whether or not we have a holding in a certain coin before making calls and being explicit about what has led us to the conclusion that a certain coin is a good pick.We also need to make sure that, as a community, we audit all information we receive too and take responsibility. I know the ‘DYOR’ mantra is “cliche”, but it’s needed.Hopefully this document serves as the conclusion of this long saga, and this can be put far in the past as we advance forward as a community.Thank you.
