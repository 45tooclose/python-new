Senno: An EvolutionSenno is a cryptocurrency running on the NEO blockchain that aims to measure sentiment on the internet. Have you ever wondered what people were thinking about a product or idea? The technology to do this has been to expensive but Senno aims to change this. Businesses no longer have to fork over large amounts of cash for the data infrastructure needed to do this. Now, they just need to connect to the Senno network through an API. Sentiment analysis is the process where all that content can be quantified to represent the ideas and opinions of entire sectors of the public. The implications are difficult to understate. Using the algorithms that all the big companies use today, this jumbled data is compiled into an easily understandable and readable report. Using blockchain, Senno can accomplish this with the Senno token being used as the currency to purchase this power. Businesses tend to overlook sentiment analysis. Or maybe they just donâ€™t understand its potential. To be fair, many sentiment analysis engines have been highly complex and expensive. For a long time, it was also doubtful how much Web 2.0 represents the sentiments of entire groups since only small portions of society were posting online. But this has changed with most of the world today being interconnected through the internet. With their ICO, Senno aims to achieve this lofty goal and decentralize the data analysis process and open it up for everyone, big and small, to use at their disposal.
