Main Goal of the SIZE TechnologyHow would you prefer to store and exchange a sensitive information?Naturally, with the highest possible level of security. Existing data storages, unfortunately, do not provide an adequate protection. The data can be intercepted, stolen, damaged, blocked or unavailable. Service providers may stop functioning temporarily or permanently for many reasons.New IDM service claims to have solved all those problems.The service is based on a new technology called SIZE. This technology provides unprecedented levels of data security and sustainability. All data is protected by an absolute cypher (one-time pad) and guarantees the post-quantum protection. An extraordinary sustainability allows to recover an initial information from only 2% (!) of remaining data.SIZE technology utilizes a new erasure code algorithm with characteristics nothing like being seen before.An application of the algorithm converts an initial data into a new format — a number of small unidentifiable packets. None of the packets carry a single bit of the initial data. Then the packets are stored separately on different nodes. The service plans to rent storage nodes from miners all over the world. With high sustainability and a developed network of miners/storage nodes the possibility of losing data is close to zero. As long as there is Internet it would be always possible to retrieve data.Follow us to learn more about this innovative technology.
