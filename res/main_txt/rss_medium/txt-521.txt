As the ICO hype subsides, how to find the next Crypto unicorn?On Apr 17 local time, China’s Hu Run Research Institute published “Hu Run Greater China Unicorn Index for Q1 2018”. Ant Financial, DiDi and XiaoMi are ranked top 3. However, despite being the hottest industry in the past few months, no blockchain enterprise made it to the list.At the same time, recent trend in blockchain industry shows: most investment institutes no longer invest in ICOs hastily, they focus more on the stock option investments on service and technical companies within the blockchain industry and on quantitative trading in secondary market. The golden era of crypto investment where people “invest in 1 ICO per week, get retired in 3 months” is gone for good.As the ICO hype subsides, we also see a shift in blockchain ecology from savage growth to healthy development: most countries released clear defined laws and regulations, many “PPT projects” have died off, investors are reverting to rationalism and looking for hardworking and down to earth projects; at the same time blockchain is going through a bearish market for those who seek short-term investment gains.Some industrial leaders point out that “this is the golden times for blockchain”, because blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are gaining unprecedented attention globally and the subsequent discussions would bring more people’s attention from price fluctuations to the actual advancement in technology and the commercialization of these projects.Where is Blockchain heading in the future? How to face the new challenges? How to find the next Crypto unicorn? At this new historical development stage, participants of Blockchain ecology have a greater need to gather and exchange new ideas on industrial development.Under these circumstances, you just cannot miss the second Blockchain Connect Conference being held on June 26 and 27 in Silicon Valley.The first Blockchain Connect Conference: the first Sino-US Blockchain summit dialogue:The first Blockchain connect conference was held on Jan 26 2018 at Palace of Fine Arts, San Francisco. More than 2000 Blockchain enthusiasts, industrial leaders and investors coming from all over the world participated in the event.This conference was organized by SV Insight and co-founded by Draper Dragon, Danhua Capital, Huobi, Consensys, Bodhi and other prominent companies. It was the first Sino-US joint dialogue on Blockchain: Litecoin founder Charlie Lee, Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Monero’s project lead Riccardo, Coinbase-IVP’s general partner Todd Chaffee and other American industrial leaders shared their opinions on Blockchain technological development and industrial trends; Qtum co-founder Chu Shuai, NEO co-founder HongFei Da, Danhua Capital co-founder and renowned physicist ShouCheng Zhang, Tencent Blockchain director YiGe Cai, OKEx CEO Chris Lee and other Chinese experts also flew in to share their observations and insights from China’s perspective.For the first time, the two strongest forces in Blockchain world, China and United States, gathered on Blockchain Connect Conference and discussed about the hottest topics like Public Chain development, scalability and forking, consensus algorithm evolution, commercial and functional DApp, new technology trends, ICO and regulations as well as exchanges and their users.Besides these VIP speakers, the exhibition section of the conference also helped a number of Blockchain start-ups to demo their projects live. The conference truly CONNECTed each other through pooling resources like media, exchanges, investment institutes and industries, and through connecting talents like developers, product managers and marketing.“one day in crypto, one year on earth”. Even though the first conference is still fresh, the entire Blockchain industry had tremendous changes in the past few months: the entire crypto market cap shrank by half, less and less ICOs are being launched, opportunists started panicking and increasing amount of people lost their faith in Blockchain.In such times, we have pressing needs to combine forces of the true thought leaders and executers of Blockchain industry, to discuss about future paths of Blockchain development in depth.The second Blockchain Connect Conference: “Catch the Next Crypto Unicorn”As a result, the second Blockchain Connect Conference came into being. It would be held on June 26–27, 2018 in San Jose Convention Center at the center of Silicon Valley.The theme of this conference is “Catch the next Crypto Unicorn”In traditional Internet domain, Unicorn represents start-ups which are founded in less than 10 years and worth over 1 billion USD. If judged by this standard, most would realize that all top 20 crypto assets can be considered unicorns, including Bitcoin — Yes, Bitcoin is less than 10 years old.However, when we talk about “the next Crypto Unicorn”, we are not only talking about cryptocurrencies with market cap over 1 billion USD. We are talking about the key participants of the Blockchain industry as well as the upstream and downstream industries. Such teams should have outstanding technologies and products, trustworthy teams and unique economic models.Besides coins and tokens, there are a lot of service and infrastructure companies in the Blockchain ecosystem which deserve our attentions. For example, companies like the biggest global Blockchain media Coindesk, US crypto exchange Coinbase, hardware wallet Ledger as well as mining and chip design company Bitmain are all indispensable sections of the entire Blockchain ecosystem. Compared to a lot of Blockchain projects which are still in early planning stage, these companies have matured and functional applications coupled with tested business models. We consider these companies Unicorns too.In addition, we came to know some traditional internet companies are seeking developments in the Blockchain space. These companies, such as US zero-commission stock trading App Robinhood which launched their Crypto trading functions and Russian communication App Telegram which launched a huge funding raising, have experienced teams and industrial resources. We consider these companies Unicorns too. Moreover, it is time for low-profile “chain” companies, which focused on Blockchain underlying technology research and development under the radar, to come under the spotlight.“Cath the Next Crypto Unicorn” has two main objectives, besides seeking the next quality project with everyone, we also want to help these new projects to grasp this opportunity of a lifetime and become a real “Unicorn”.In order to offer real assistance to all quality Blockchain projects, the second Blockchain Connect Conference prepared below components:1. In the exhibition area, combined with online interaction, we will create a hiring fair. In current times where Blockchain technology and community talents are in shortage, we will help projects find the best hire in talent-intensive Silicon Valley;2. We will arrange for professionals in Legal, Tax, Regulation and Community Operations to share about hidden traps in relation to Blockchain start-ups and help projects comply with regulations and operate more efficiently;3. We will also select outstanding investment agencies, exchanges, consulting companies, technical suppliers and media to join the relevant sections of the conference, so you can find the most needed resourcesKnowing how difficult it is to advance in this industry, we seek to create a better Blockchain Connect Conference.
