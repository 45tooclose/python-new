Presale has finishedOur presale has finished. It was not as good as we planned due to several reasons:Marketing was badThe project was not described in fullThere were many technical faultsThere was no presentation at conferencesWe think that the site’s structure was not too goodOther small mistakesWe have ended presale with the result of 200 ETH though the aim was 500 ETH.Today we negotiate with 5 investors that are supposed to close our hard cap. Also we give a possibility to jump into the train that has started moving for everyone else.BTW one can supply into buying tokens both for private and public sale”
