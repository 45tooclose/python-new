QuarkChain - ICO ReviewWhat is QuarkChain?QuarkChain is a Blockchain project whose innovations are centered around the idea of sub-chains, chards and root-chains. The QuarkChain ICO commenced this month (May 2018) with the platform’s tokens (QKS)being offered to the public in a Crowdsale.Self- described as a “highly scalable, decentralized, secure, public, permission-less Blockchain.”, the primary goal of the QuarkChain Blockchain is facilitating a forward push of the industry by delivering an enhanced transactional capability.How QuarkChain WorksThe platform offers a highly-scalable Blockchain with claims of being able to process a million transactions per second on its Blockchain. QuarkChain is able to achieve better scalability with the use of a 2-layer structure.The first offering elastic sharding (i.e., a database partitioning which separates large databases into smaller, faster components called data shards). Data shards are easier to manage and are an important part of the QuarkChain project.The second layer is the root Blockchain (i.e., a component that confirms transactions/blocks pushed by the first layer). Quarkchain’s second layer can be “resharded” as necessary without the root layer being changed.Another Quarkchain’s unique feature is its ability to offer assured security via market-driven collaborative mining.In essence, 50% of QuarkChain network’s power is dedicated to the root Blockchain with the specific purpose of preventing double-spending attacks. Additionally, multiple low-resource nodes can cluster together to form a supernode.QuarkChain offers two varieties of efficient cross-shard transactions:· In-shard transactions: occurs when both input and output addresses belong in the same shard· Cross-shard transactions: occurs when the addresses are in different shards.Lastly, with a simple account dashboard, users get to interact with the QuarkChain Blockchain, viewing all crypto assets from different Blockchains (i.e., different shards) and managing all addresses with a single private key.QuarkChain supports smart contracts (specifically smart contracts running within EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). This means developers get to deploy their smart contracts directly to QuarkChain.Breaking all these technologies down sees QuarkChain boast eight (8) minor Blockchains are having a target block time of ten seconds (10s) alongside a root Blockchain having a target block time of one hundred and fifty seconds (150s).The QuarkChain (QKC) TokenDuring the ongoing ICO, QuarkChain avails its tokens (QKC) in a Crowdsale.NB: QKCs are ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum Blockchain.QuarkChain (QKC) TokensUses of QKC TokensAt launch, the purchased QuarkChain (QKC) tokens can be used as:· A store of value· A transactional currency· A contribution rewardYou should also know that QKC tokens will be mineable since QuarkChain is a PoW Blockchain.What Problems does QuarkChain SolveAs with all Blockchain projects, QuarkChain comes with a unique value proposition. It looks to solve a variety of problems that are not being solved by existing Blockchains.So, why do we need QuarkChain?The QuarkChain whitepaper highlights these issues, they include:· Blockchain security issues· Decentralization; a truly decentralized Blockchain· Scalability issues· The Lightning Network problem with current BlockchainsQuarkChain FeaturesSome of the offered features of the QuarkChain Blockchain includes:· Cross-Shard Transactions· Cross-Chain Transactions· Anti-Centralized Horizontal Scalability Expansion· The QuarkChain Smart WalletConclusionQuarkChain is one 2018’s most interesting Blockchain projects investors should keep an eye out for. It does look like a winner, and we project it will get into the top 25 tokens (by market cap) by the end of 2018.
