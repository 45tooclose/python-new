Development news and application sneak peek — April 2018For the last two months our team has worked hard on the product development, token sale activities and business partner relations. We have been actively informing our community about onboarding some of the top blockchain experts, acquiring strategic partners and presenting the case studies on RxEAL application during this time. Having said that, we did fall behind in communicating about the product development, so today we are giving a sneak peek into our platform and providing insights on what we have been working on.A look insideWe made a good progress in platform development and are ready to give a sneak peek into the results. Current work is focused on finishing the application, which includes Angular JS based front-end and PHP + Node.js back-end.The goal of the application is to deliver user friendly and intuitive way to create and manage smart rental deposit contracts. We have focused on building a user interface that is familiar to a common online service user:RxEAL application dashboard and the landing page after the authorization provides a quick overview of all the updates and ongoing processes in your account.Settings page — giving users the option to customize their experience.Contract creation page provides a simple way to generate a deposit contract with no technical knowledge required. The selected variables will be applied to the smart contract under the hood.Becoming an arbitrator on RxEAL platform is a challenging but rewarding process. Once the arbitrator qualification is acquired, you are able to earn RXL tokens by solving the dispute cases.Next stepsWhile a significant amount of work has been done, there is still much work ahead. Together with application we are building an API to make RxEAL platform pluggable into the existing systems for corporate clients.When the work on the application and API is finished, we are focusing resources on the last stage — smart contracts. We are approaching smart contracts at the final stage to stay on the edge of the technological developments given its fast changing environment.Once all stages completed, the RxEAL platform is ready to begin improving rental experience for people all around the world. We expect the fully functional platform release in late Q3 2018.ChallengesCurrently our token sale funding progress is sitting shy above the minimum soft cap and therefore we have to go one development step at a time, as we cannot allocate resources for simultaneous work on multiple stages. Although it slows down the process, we can assess all the work done carefully to deliver a polished product from the very first release — this is why we see this current challenge as an opportunity.Join usTo be the part of the transformation of rental markets, you can support the project by purchasing tokens with the bonus rate in our token sale that will be live until May 11th 12:00 UTC.Participate on official website: https://rxeal.comFollow us:Telegram: http://t.me/rxealofficialTwitter: https://twitter.com/rxealofficialFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RxEAL
