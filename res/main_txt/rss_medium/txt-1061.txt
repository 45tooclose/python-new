Thank you for this Michael Flaxman, My Co-Founder read this and says it sounds like me.I’m running one of the largest English speaking Crypto communities in China, and over the past year or so I’ve been saying a lot of the things you wrote here.I chose this highlight this because this is what I believe is the clearest obstacle of teams who are capable and truly believe building their product, and by ICOing they are shooting themselves in both legs.I’m a grinding startup founder, and I’ve been asked by my community many times why didn’t I ICO. The vision of what I’m building does involve a censorship resistant and decentralized governance system. I want to find product market fit first, and I don’t need blockchain for that.My position ever since the Bancor induced ICO mania was that ICOs are skipping the most important step in a startup’s cycle — finding product market fit.I like to give the example of kickstarter/indigogo, ICOs is kickstarter on cocaine and redbull. When someone pledges money to a kickstarter campaign they want to use the product — a smart drone, carbon fiber wallet, or some epic summer socks. When someone sends money (me included) to an ICO, I may think that the product is interesting and innovative, but I don’t plan on using it, I plan on making profit on my investment. This is the reality of most ICO ‘investors’. The result of this are teams raising millions in Ethereum, creating products that might be useful, but that no one will want to use. Build it and they will come… won’t they.
