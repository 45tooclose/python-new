If Bitcoin does fall during a forecast period then the Bitcoin Enhanced coin rises by the same percentage that Bitcoin fell. Conversely if Bitcoin’s price rose during a forecast period then the Bitcoin Enhanced price falls by a corresponding amount. When a forecast period is over Bitcoin Enhanced continues to track the percentage changes in the Bitcoin price, but now with a multiplier based on whether previous forecasts have been successful.In essence the Bitcoin Enhanced coin takes Bitcoin’s notorious volatility and turns it to positive effect.
