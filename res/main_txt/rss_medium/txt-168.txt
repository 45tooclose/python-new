On the VergeImage Credit: SpaceXAt a bar last Thursday, it took me a couple of minutes — after several drinks — to remember the term “accredited investor.”An accredited investor has money… more specifically, enough money that the government deems him or her worthy… or rather risk-tolerant enough to be able to invest in the private markets.Cody Shirk, last Friday, voiced a criticism of this approach:“Again, the accredited investor requirement makes sense in theory. Protecting the small, and the presumably unsophisticated individual investor is a good thing.But, in reality, when someone self-certifies as an accredited investor, they are really taking the risk off of the investment issuer. Or in other words, whoever is taking the investment money must be able to say, ‘Well, we only accept accredited investors who know and understand the risks.’A better requirement might be to have investors take a test to ensure they understand certain risks in the investing world. This would allow individuals to be approved as ‘sophisticated’ based on their knowledge, instead of how they accumulated their wealth. (Many countries actually do this.)”Accredited Investor... Wait I Mean, Accredited InterrogatorOne of the most ridiculous rules in the investing world is the accredited investor requirement.

The private markets have taken over the public markets’ role in capital raising, but the public markets have retained their role in capital return. If that’s the model then you’d expect an IPO slowdown during the transition, and then a return to IPOs once the transition is complete.
