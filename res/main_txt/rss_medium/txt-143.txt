Inferno market updateWe have broken out of the downward-sloping channel. The picture for bitcoin is now more bullish, with prices pushing well above $8,000.Last week’s analysis was bleak, with many indicators bearish and a great deal of uncertainty hanging over the market. The saying goes that the darkest hour is just before dawn, and there’s some logic to that where markets are concerned. Bearish traders had already exited to fiat, leaving little downward pressure and allowing buyers to take over.The sharp move upward that followed — and, indeed, the patterns that have appeared in the charts over recent days — have the hallmarks of manipulation. Long green candles, followed by a gentler rise or fall, then a large red candle: these have caught many traders unawares. But there is clearly also growing re-engagement from the wider community, and new traders.Looking at our ‘Double Bubble Analysis’ (https://medium.com/@CryptoInferno/double-bubble-analysis-update-7c78925dc956) we can see that the pattern should now have played out. The timescale for the bear market is complete, with bitcoin failing to drop below that $6,000 low. The choreography for whatever happens next will be different, but we note that the fundamentals are strong and there is still considerable interest — this time from institutions and ‘smart money’ rather than regular retail traders.
