7 Reasons Why You Should Invest in BMXWhat is BMX?When Binance first launched the price of Binance coin (BNB) was $0.12, now 10 months later BNB is worth $12.00. That’s 10000% growth! Imagine the profit you could have made if you were an early investor. While it may be too late to see that kind of ROI from purchasing BNB, there is a new exchange with a utility coin offering the same functions as BNB.The new exchange I’m talking about is BitMart. Their platform launched in March along with the offering of their utility token, BMX. BMX is an ERC-20 based utility token issued by BitMart with total volume of 1,000,000,000. Like BNB, BMX can be used as payment for transaction fees. BitMart will also employ the same practice of using 20% of profits each month to repurchase BMX tokens and then destroy them. By destroying BMX tokens, the value should increase as a result of supply and demand.7 Reasons Why You Should Invest in BMX:1. Future Appreciation PotentialBitMart aims to become a leading cryptocurrency exchange providing spot trading, futures trading, over-the-counter trading, whole-network trading, and decentralized trading. As the utility token for these services, BMX shows great potential to appreciate in value. Especially as the exchange starts to list more coins and experiences growth in trading volume.2. Payment for Transaction FeesWhen users conduct transactions on BitMart, they can use BMX on the trading fees, no matter what tokens they trade.3. Easy to RegisterMany exchanges are either not accepting new users or require waiting periods that can last for weeks. In all that time spent waiting, an opportunity could pass right by. BitMart recognizes this problem and that’s why their registration process takes mere seconds to complete. Over 300,000 people have already joined since their launch.4. Promotions for Free BMXWho doesn’t like free stuff? Right now new users can receive 20 BMX just for registering. You can also receive an additional 10 BMX for each new user that joins using your referral link.5. Secure and ReliableTrust goes a long way in today’s crypto market. BitMart’s highly secure and efficient matching engine technology ensures that you receive the best prices. They also implement hot/cold wallet technology for storage of their funds, with NetGap technology being used by the hot wallet. In addition, the operating modes of secret keys and addresses are optimized based on the features of each blockchain node to ensure the security of users’ assets.6. Strong Brand ImageA great project that isn’t marketed properly means nothing. To spread the word about their platform BitMart has posted press releases on CCN and NewsBTC, along with ads in Times Square. Their team has attended multiple speaking engagements, including at international conferences. They also have a strong digital presence, with accounts across every major social media channel.7. An International Team of ProfessionalsWith a world-class Technical team, a Legal Consultant team, a professional Coin Listing Review team, and an International Marketing and Operation Team, BitMart has all the tools to succeed in today’s global cryptocurrency market.As BitMart continues to grow and list more coins, their volume will increase and lead to a higher demand for BMX in order to pay their transaction fees. Currently, BMX is up 40% and has a value of $0.06 USD at price of 0.00011 ETH. Overall, I believe that this will be one of the hottest coins of 2018 and it deserves your attention.Disclaimer: This is my own personal opinion and not financial advice.
