Pound for PoundThe Dog Pound began as an open, free crypto trading community in the late summer of 2017. Anyone was welcome to come and contribute resources, thoughts, analysis, and so on. Over time we grew very large, in fact, a bit too large.We experienced growing pains in the form of a flood of requests to help and members’ voices clashing attempting to meet the demand. We had trouble separating the signal from the noise and the massive size of the group bottlenecked useful input.In response, we re-developed The Dog Pound into a private community wherein anyone could join and contribute through monthly fees or analysis and information. We’ve been exponentially accumulating amazing traders ever since.Testimonials from subscribers at The Dog PoundNew members can join by paying a monthly fee. These funds are pooled and divided among the contributors that provide the most, voted on by the subscribers. Anyone can provide their own analysis/information and win these “bounties.”We host a monthly poll wherein all members can vote for their top three contributors in different categories (bounties). Winners then receive Dog Pound funds from the monthly fees directly after winning.I take a portion of the fees myself for my own work and contributions (10%), but the majority goes straight back to the community. In fact, our top contributor Blues Crypto (https://twitter.com/BluesCrypto) performed so well he earned more of The Dog Pound pool than I did, and rightfully so — he did an amazing job providing fantastic content in many different areas.So, what kind of content do you get in the Dog Pound?Daily expert Bitcoin price analysis by our top tradersMargin trading set-upsLong term altcoin entries (Pound Picks)Short term altcoin trading set-upsExclusive ICO investment & pooling opportunities…and so much more!
