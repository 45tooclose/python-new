COIN TO CHAT ABOUT: CHATCOINChat it now, while is still low.This is a pure technical analysis without dwelling much on the project’s roadmap.CHAT volume in Binance is fairly strong, it’s got over 950BTC at the time of writing.This is another lazy coin, but don’t under estimate as some willing buyers are ready to value this coin at 1342, and hoping to sell back at 1460.Though I won’t have objection to enter anywhere around 1350.So why not? The uptrend has started about two weeks ago although it wasn’t noticeable.I used the flow index to check traction and found an unusual pattern over there. Perhaps someone from Pump & Dump group can verify this.Keep an eye on the Pump announcement, and ride the wave.Good luck!
