Earn More Points in Phase 3Phase 3 of The CryptalDash New Coin Listing Competition has begun and we have exciting news.Now halfway through the competition, we are getting more and more coins in. The competition is getting tougher, so we developed a new point system for the votes. The improved point system increases your chances of earning more points for your coin.Starting now, all points will reset to zero after every phase. This levels the playing field and creates equal opportunities for every coin to be part of the CryptalDash Exchange. Now all coins have a chance to win in every phase.Speaking of having a fresh start, the new point system is also better and more competitive than before.· For social share, every medium or channel now has its corresponding points.· Instead of getting 1,000 points after every purchase of CRD tokens, now you can get 1point for every $1 worth of purchase, which means if you purchase $500,000 worth of CRD tokens, you will get 500,000 points as well!· Coins can now earn more points through multiple high leverage promotions available to the core team members. All they need to do is submit proof of these promotions for verification. Each of the following promotion is equivalent to 5,000 points.-Email to customers-Website banner/embed widget-Social promotions (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn)-Reddit promotion-Bitcoin talk promotionWe told you Phase 3 is going to be big and it is!
