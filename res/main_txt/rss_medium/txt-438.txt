EOS and CARDANO on Coinbase in 2018!1) Coinbase made an announcement to list ERC-20 TokensOn 26th March Coinbase made an official statement stating they will support ERC-20 Tokens on the condition that the SEC will regulate and deem cryptocurrencies to be a security as opposed to a digital currency. Both EOS and ADA Cardano are ERC 20 Tokens.2) Coinbase only lists Cryptos that are within the Top 10 Market CapAs of 2018, Coinbase supports 4 cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Etheruem, Litecoin. All of these cryptocurrencies share a commonality, they are within the top 10 Market Cap of all cryptos. Therefore, as EOS and ADA Cardano are now within the Top 10, it’s safe to say Coinbase will be listing these tokens in 2018.3) CNBC has promoted EOS and Cardano multiple timesCNBC’s Fast Money TV Show is the mainstream news show for cryptocurrency that the world listens to. As a result, by promoting EOS and ADA Cardano on CNBC, and the fact that the exchange they promote is Coinbase, it’s obvious that they’re hinting as a possible listing for these Tokens on Coinbase to their audience.4) EOS’s Price is behaving like BITCOIN CASH before it was listed on CoinbaseBefore Bitcoin Cash was listed on Coinbase, 2 days before it’s price skyrocketed, and it was obvious that insider trading was taking place, as it was later added on Coinbase. The same pattern seems to be happening with EOS. People are becoming bullish on EOS for no apparent reason, quite similar to Ripple back in January.
