Deedcoin Founder’s CornerCharles Wismer, Co-Founder of DeedcoinFounder’s Corner 04/24Hey everyone,It has been a big week for the Deedcoin development team! We will be launching the ERC223 protocol Deedcoin tommorow. This will be a smooth transition and only the smart contract address will need to be updated. All future Deedcoin after the conversion will be on the cutting edge 223 protocol.Keep an eye out for the new Deedcoin user portal on www.Deedcoin.com. We have secured the URL for the future of the Deedcoin solution and will be replacing the current landing page with the second version of the HQ portal. This version will bring simplicity to the process and showcase our direction for the future of the company. ETA: Seven more days of development.Lastly, remember the sales phase is opening next Monday, April 30th. Watch the timer in the sales portal and join our telegram to have any questions answered. This sales phase will be brief, at only 72 hours, with a limit of 350k tokens sold. Although the sales phases are important, they require attention to manage and reduce our development hours. For that reason, we will be opening in shorter sales windows in the future to keep things moving along most effectivelyAs always, thank you to the Deedcoin family for your support!Charles Wismer- Deedcoin Co-Founder
