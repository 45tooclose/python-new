There are a LOT of things that can be done with private-key crypto. So Iâ€™m not convinced this has value for warranties on consumer appliances. Someone has to physically go out to do the repair, and they could just scan a signed barcode-equivalent which would check against original sales. (Or many other configurations that take advantage of physical presence.)But keeping counterfeit parts out of high-tech supply chains is important. Tracing a $30 chip through 4 levels of supply chains? Possibly appropriate for blockchain. But it has so much overhead, how can it be cost-effective? Always consider the alternative, such as having the OEM take responsibility for tracking. See https://hackernoon.com/ten-years-in-nobody-has-come-up-with-a-use-case-for-blockchain-ee98c180100
