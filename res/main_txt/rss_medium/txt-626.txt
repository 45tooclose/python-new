Block Wars mainnet launch date setAfter many hard months of game theory and coding we have finally reached the day where we can announce that we’re ready for mainnet release! It’s gonna be on May 7th, which is only 10 days away!!! We are super excited and hope you will like our game. We also hope the Ethereum mainnet is ready for us!? :)A new feature we have added is that a player will get a boost during an attack when having adjacent blocks. This goes for both attacker as well as defender. In the example below the cat is being attacked by us (Block Wars). We get a tiny boost from our already owned block while the cat is getting a bigger boost from its adjacent block. In total we have a 42% chance of winning the attack. One way of increasing the chance is to increase the attack amount. There are other ways as well but let’s leave them for the players to figure out.Have a good one and don’t forget to join our competition to win grand prizes in the form of genesis blocks and battle points!
