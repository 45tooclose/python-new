MyDFS ICO reviewMyDFS is a blockchain-powered daily fantasy sports platform from some of the developers of uTrener and KHL Fantasy apps. MyDFS runs on a platform and on mobile devices and connects sports fans around the world in a transparent, easy-to-use manner.BackgroundThe online fantasy sports industry has experienced stable growth every year, There is a lot of money in the fantasy industry and the userbase keeps on growing worldwide. It’s not just user base that grows, but also the money users spend on fantasy sports related gaming industry. For example, the average fantasy player spent in average $420€ on fantasy sport in 2017 - it takes no Einstein to forsee that that the value of the total money used in this industry increases over the next years.There is some issues about the existing technology behind fantasy sports: - Uncertain legal statuses - high marketing budgets- complicated user verifications - money withdrawal problems and transer issues- complex user interfacesThe two big pioneers in the market today is DraftKings and FanDuel. These two giants now faces serious problems that include badly balanced marketing budgets, little external competition, a number of monopoly scandals, and the inability to challenge the tough laws and regulations that control the business of fantasy sports.These issues with current technology and the problems with the big players on the market calls for a Blockchain solution and that is what MyDFS will do - not by competing with the existing market, but they will redefine the industry itself.Token usageYou can utilize MyDFS tokens to play, win, and exchange it for other cryptocurrency or fiat loan. The Tokens are going to be used to engage the community and make it grow — and when the community and the userbase grows the demand of the token will increase.The tokens will be used in playing gamesPlayers can use the token to buy subscriptions and content within the gamePlayers can use the tokens for making peer-to-peer based transfers inside the gaming platformPlayers can use them for investing with other players on the MyDFS platformAnd off course the tokens can be converted with other cryptocurrencies and then to fiat — we all love fiat :DThe visionAnd one last thing before we go to the details, and a very important one…..The goal for MYDFS is to release the app just before FIFA 2018 World Cup. The cup will be held in Russia and it’s the ideal time to attract a wide audience of fans as well as grow the userbase. And it will be a massive exposure of the platform, app and off course the demand of the token.RisksOf course, the main risk is that of competition. The fantasy sports market is quite competitive, and its blockchain segment is not standing still. Therefore it is very important that MyDFS is launching its full functionality by the summer of 2018. Speed ​​and quality means a lot here. I believe the team has the experience to reach their deadlines, but off course there will be bumps on the way like in all crypto…..Additional infoWebsiteWhitepaperRoadmap (I tryed to make it so its easy to watch)Tokensale infoTicker; MyDFSPre-ICO: Apr 16, 2018 — May 6, 2018ICO: May 21, 2018 — Jun 12, 2018 or until the hard cap is reachedPre-sale hardcap — $3,000,000Crowdsale softcap — $4,000,000Crowdsale hardcap — $40,000,000MyDFS token basic price: $1Pre-sale start price: $0,7Well guys take a look and see you on discord and check out my teams website :D take care
