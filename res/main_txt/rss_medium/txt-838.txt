I’m going to split the Braingasm and Newsgasm sections into separate posts. Content should be more or less the same]NewsgasmHere’s a bunch of interesting reading that gets into detail about what cryptoassets are, could be, or maybe even should be: Is Ether a security? Valuing cryptoassets from the ground up. Should central banks issue cryptocurrencies? And finally, why tokens are fundamental to cryptocurrencies. That last one is particularly interesting given calls from time to time that blockchain tech and cryptocurrencies are somehow useful when separated. #cryptocurrencies #blockchain #bitcoin #ethereumThis adds some useful colour for when, and when not, to use blockchain tech: A blockchain is a specific set of choices suitable for a narrow set of use-cases.

Taking the time to tell a decent story goes a long way to assisting in the communication of complex ideas. #communication #meetingsBlue Origin’s New Shepard rocket has just sucessfully completed its 8th mission. Watching rockets land on their thrusters is pretty amazing. #space #rocketsThis is some (brief) but amazing (and presumably authentic) footage of the view from the surface of a comet. #space #cometThe sci-fi of Stanislav Lem is uniquely unsettling, and Memoirs Found in a Bathtub is one of the most unsettling bits of fiction I’ve ever come across. He also wrote about the future of humanity in a book that almost nobody read. In it, Lem concludes that “if our technological civilization is to avoid falling into decay, human obsolescence in one form or another is unavoidable.” #futureofhumanity #scifiOnly in AustraliaElderly dog helps save girl lost in Australian bush. “I shot up the mountain and when I came to the top, the dog came to me and led me straight to her.” #oooohhhh #onlyinaustraliaRegards,M@
