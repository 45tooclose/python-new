The Latest in Crypto-Innovation: New Dawn Announces the Launch of the World’s First Retail Crypto FundMelbourne, Australia, Tuesday April 17, 2018 — New Dawn Fund Pty Ltd opened their doors on Friday, April 13, 2018 to become the world’s first and only cryptocurrency fund open to retail investors.The recent rise in the number of global cryptocurrency hedge funds has been nothing short of meteoric. The total number of registered cryptocurrency hedge funds in the beginning of 2017 was 37 (globally). By the beginning of 2018, they numbered at 226 funds (globally). Last year’s non-stop surge in cryptocurrency prices fueled this growth, providing outsized returns for investment entities that normally would not see double- and triple-digit returns.The recent volatility in cryptocurrency prices have left trading-focused funds struggling to make acceptable returns. Despite such volatility, investor appetite for the crypto market continues to remain robust. Besides extreme market volatility, one of the largest problems facing cryptocurrency investors is the lack of options into different crypto-related investment vehicles. With hedge funds normally catering to wholesale and institutional investors, retail investors are blocked off from the ability to invest in ICOs and mining contracts.The innovative structure of the New Dawn Fund solves two of the biggest problems plaguing cryptocurrency investors today: (1) inclusion into the numerous return-generating avenues in the crypto field, and (2) sophisticated management of market risk, using tools normally available only to institution-focused hedge funds.NDF utilizes capital for the purposes of investment within the cryptocurrency and blockchain asset classes, which include, but is not limited to:- Holding cryptocurrency portfolios- Algorithmic automated trading- Traditional trading- Copy trading- Mergers and Acquisitions- Venture investments- High-yield affiliated marketing programs for crypto-related products and services including exchanges, cold storage and devices, portfolio tracking software, charting software, e-wallets and crypto debit cards.- ICO underwriting- ICO investments (including leveraging pre-ICO/ICO discounts)- Security-backed tokens, particularly in real estate assets- Commercial crypto mining- Distributed crypto mining- Arbitrage TradingWhile based out of Australia, New Dawn employs a global team of top quants, analysts, and technology partners dedicated to creating tools that manage the market risks specifically inherent to the crypto field.
