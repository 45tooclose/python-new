That will give them a rough number of ETH to be collected.  Then they will conduct the process as follows: For example: 8000 ETH with 2000 whitelisted participants.First 12 hours: max contribution x ETH, where x = 8000/4/2000 = 1next 8 hours: max contribution 2x ETHnext 4 hours: max contribution 4x ETHnext 2 hours: max contribution 8x ETHnext 1 hours: max contribution 16x ETH… until fillThis ensures the Public Sale will last at least 24+ hours, in order to accommodate investors from all time zones.Useful links:Webpage: https://www.quarkchain.io/Whitepaper: https://quarkchain.io/quark.pdfTelegram: https://t.me/quarkchainFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/quarkchain.quark.5Twitter: https://twitter.com/quark_chainGithub: https://github.com/QuarkChain
