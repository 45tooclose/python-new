The altcoin I am betting on for 2018With the increase in the number of ICO’S lately and the majority of them being scams, I am going to invest only in listed altcoins on the market. The coin that amazed me and made me bet big on is called BITCOIN PRIVATE (BTCP). Bitcoin private is a hard fork of Bitcoin and Zclassic coin. Thus it has all the benefits of Bitcoin and Zclassic and being a hard fork it is immune from the negatives of both the coins.Features of BTCP:1. Coinmarketcap Rank: 362. Total Supply: 21 million3. Current Price: 26 USD4. Exchanges: Trade Satoshi, Nanex, Exrates, TradeOgre, Octaex.Bitcoin Private is Private, Decentralised, Open source, Fast, Community Driven coin.Private: Bitcoin Private uses the same privacy technology as ZClassic (zk-snarks). This means payments are published on a public blockchain, but the sender, recipient and other transactional metadata remain unidentifiable.Decentralised: Just like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Private supports peer-to-peer transactions without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes through the use of cryptography and recorded in a public ledger.Fast: Unlike Bitcoin, Bitcoin Private supports a slightly increased block size while being more anonymous and secure than any existing Bitcoin-based currency without sacrificing transaction speeds.Open Source: Bitcoin Private’s entire codebase is publicly available for viewing and verification by anyone. It will always remain open source and be maintained by an ever-growing community.Community Driven: In the nature of transparency and open source, Bitcoin Private is developed by team members all over the world. Each member fills roles and contributes based on his or her skill sets.There was no premine, and there is no founder’s reward. Bitcoin Private has been released in a fair manner to all. Coins were distributed on a 1:1 basis to BTC and ZCL holders.To know more about the coin visit — https://btcprivate.org
