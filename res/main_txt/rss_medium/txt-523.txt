“The Future Has Cum” — Pornhub Announces Crypto AcceptancePornhub has long been one of the most vocal and visible adult sites when it comes to social media marketing, providing adult entertainment, and doing some good in the world, but now Pornhub has proven that it is also dedicated to the advancement of technology with the announcement that it will be accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment. The video, published April 17, 2018 on both the Pornhub website as well as on YouTube, indicated that Pornhub will be accepting the token Verge as a payment for their Premium Service.The video released in conjunction with the announcement is set in a futuristic setting (the year 2077), and features an aged grandfather recounting tossing a virtual Verge coin to his grandson before recounting the emergence of cryptocurrency and prior use of currency — calling dollar bills “filthy slips of paper” — before indicating that “everything changed” and that “porn had always been the tipping point” with “online payments, video streaming, VR,” and saying, “it was only a matter of time before everyone else caught on. The future had finally cum.”Pornhub’s crypto page featured the following statement, along with a video announcement:“The future has come [ed. note: -5 points for missing that pun]. In our efforts to keep current with our community’s privacy and payment preferences, Pornhub will now be accepting Verge as a means of payment for services like Pornhub Premium and more, on our platforms. Building on Verge’s core values of security, anonymity and practicality, the introduction of this cryptocurrency as a means of payment Pornhub signifies an important foray into the future from the industry that is always on the cutting edge of technology.”Speaking specifically to the anonymity of the token, Pornhub Vice President of Operations Corey Price said, “We’re extremely excited to offer our fans the ability to use crypto and think Verge, with its focus on anonymity, is the best option — whether for privacy, convenience, or both.”Pornography has long driven technological advancement, and it appears that the early adoption of cryptocurrency for paid subscriptions is no different. From 8mm video cameras to VHS tapes to DVDs to streaming, and now, to cryptocurrency payments, porn has paved the way for innovation. We shall end in the eloquent words of Pornhub, as they concluded their YouTube description, “Let’s make it chain!”
