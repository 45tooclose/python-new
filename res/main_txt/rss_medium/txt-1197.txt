CryptoSpaceX: Game Updates and Contest AnnouncementsHuh? What Game? Head over to our introductory article first.“Build Your Own Starship” design challengeWe, at CryptoSpace X, are in the process of creating a Star Wars themed Space Strategy game powered by the Ethereum blockchain — the brainchild of a conglomeration of Star Wars fans and Blockchain enthusiasts. Design would be an integral part of this project and we strongly believe that creativity should not be confined by any kinds of boundaries.The first challenge put forth by our team is the “Build Your Own Starship” design challenge. We invite all designers to participate in this, wherein they would be required to design a unique starship, borne out of their imagination, creativity and talent, that they would like to be featured in our game. A combined pool of starships, designed both by our team and by you, the designers, would be put up for auction once the token sales start. How does this work now? Before the launch of the game Episode I in June, users will get a one-time-opportunity to bid for these starships. Only one of each starship would be up for purchase and upon sale, the highest bidder would be able to use it as an in-game asset. 80% of the Ethereum collected by each starship would be sent as a reward to the respective designing artist. Every starship would also feature the designer’s name in its description, hence ensuring the brilliant designer his due credits and praise!Top 5 selected artworks will also be rewarded by the CryptoSpaceX team.
