MIMIR Blockchain Solutions Development Update April 27Events:The Prendergast’s take New York this weekend where Hunter will be speaking at Fordham University on Sunday. If you happen to be in the neighborhood, let us know and maybe we can schedule a time to meet/chat.Alpha:The alpha saw a series of bug fixes and improvements to communication protocols this week. We fixed an error which was causing messages to be dropped when routing to worker clients. We also fixed an overly sensitive health-check route which was triggering unnecessary restarts on healthy micro-services. More globally speaking, we finished a number of improvements to blockchain state management/monitoring code. This included moving to a more stable method of smart-contract event monitoring and migrating some old code to now work with the latest version of web3. Overall, this week was focused on some housekeeping on our end to keep working toward a cleaner user experience.Keep an eye on our Github for all the latest pushes and updated DOCS.
