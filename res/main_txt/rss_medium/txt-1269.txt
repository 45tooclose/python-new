Banks in China Adopt New SystemsBlockchain is exploding on a global scale. While the food industry in the USA like Walmart is adopting blockchain technology as a new system for their products, all the way across the planet in China, banks are just beginning to apply blockchain technology for many different uses. So far, twelve out of twenty-six Chinese banks have adopted blockchain.The rate at which these banks are quickly making use of the new system is only more impressive when we realize the increasingly wide spectrum of purposes it is serving. These applications run the gambit all the way from issuing invoices and cross-border loans to authenticating IDs.Let’s take a look at just one of these banks, The Agriculture Bank of China. This bank is owned by the state and has recently installed blockchain technology to grant unsecured loans for agricultural e-commerce merchants.Bank of China, another bank making use of blockchain systems, has been running tests for an IT infrastructure to operate on a distributed network. It has finally announced the tests’ completion, making known its intention to spread the new technology across their other branches.Blockchain’s spread throughout China’s banking system doesn’t stop there and continues through operations across many different sector. In fact, most state-owned banks in China are doing significant research into solving data storage issues using the modern blockchain system.The new technology is, indeed, encompassing hundreds of sectors and is growing by the day. In its wake, we are continually seeing a rise in efficiency and solutions for global issues that we may have thought would remain unsolved.
