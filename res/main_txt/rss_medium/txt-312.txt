What is BMX and Why You Need to Know About ItWhen Binance first launched, the price of Binance coin (BNB) was $0.12. 10 months later BNB is now worth $12.00. That’s 10000% growth! Imagine the profit you could have made if you were an early investor. While it may be too late to see that kind of ROI from purchasing BNB, there is a new exchange with a utility coin offering the same functions as BNB.The new exchange I’m talking about is BitMart. Their platform launched in March along with the offering of their utility token, BMX. Like BNB, BMX can be used as payment for transaction fees. BitMart will also employ the same practice of using 20% of profits each month to repurchase BMX tokens and then destroy them. By destroying BMX tokens, the value should increase as a result of supply and demand.As BitMart continues to grow and list more coins, their volume will increase and lead to a higher demand for BMX in order to pay their transaction fees. Currently, BMX is up 40% and has a value of $0.06 USD at price of 0.00011 ETH. New registrants receive 20 BMX for joining, while you can also use your referral link to invite others for an additional 10 BMX each. Overall, I believe that this will be one of the hottest coins of 2018 and it deserves your attention.Disclaimer: This is my own personal opinion and not financial advice.
