Walmart Ushers in Blockchain TechnologyOne of the largest world superstore chains, Walmart, has seized a major portion of its industry. The brand has overtaken the market and most live within driving distance to a Walmart store. With its purchase of ASDA overseas, Walmart has expanded its global market even further.Walmart has now begun to leap into the next sector of business. It is taking the food industry to the next level by making use of modern blockchain technology. The company has made a request of their suppliers and is now making full use of the blockchain by having the suppliers put food on it, thereby reducing waste, enhancing transparency and helping to solve the problem of contamination cases.Having begun its research in 2016, the store is now ready to bring the blockchain to the next level and has finally applied it with its live food industry.Vice president of food and health safety, Frank Yiannas, confirmed the plans and also went further during a speech at an MIT conference saying that, using blockchain technology, produce tracking was cut from six days to five seconds, a major step for the food industry.It seems even the food sector has finally seen the significant effects blockchain technology is having on even the most unlikely industries. Without a doubt, Walmart is looking to apply this modern system with great visions of the future.
