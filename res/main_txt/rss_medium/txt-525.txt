Disciplina.io — a Massive Project That Can Change the Approach to EducationAuthor — jupppo https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=161042Wallet address — 0xE50f8f7B5BbaffBC729Ac25dFDC0A4a70389062Bhttps://disciplina.io/For some reason, mostly people are very worried about the fact that the Internet is too much information about them. As it seems to me, this happens for two reasons:- My data can be used by intruders;- Very often the information is not reliable.Of course, all this is very correct. However, sooner or later we will be forced to publish information about ourselves on the Internet simply because of competition for jobs. I believe that you will agree with me, but every year the Internet penetrates deeper and deeper into all spheres of human life. We can assume that in ten years the world will become completely digital, and each person will have his own unique name from several figures.It will contain absolutely everything. The history of diseases, the names of teachers, places of work and much moreBut why wait? Already market has such offers, based on the blockchain. One of such projects is Disciplina.io, the developers of which set themselves a bold task to unite the whole process of education into one continuous line.We all know very well how often universities, schools and other specialized educational institutions like to lose our documents. And each time you have to spend your time on their recovery. Moreover, not all of us were lucky to be born in good and rich countries. A huge number of people have to learn and compete in countries with corruption. I believe that at least once the reader of this article has encountered a correction of already posted estimates and attendance schedule.Developers of Disciplina.io assure that if you use their system, then this will be avoided. This is explained by the creation of its own blockchain technology, working on a unique algorithm. The latter guarantees the reliability, integrity and immutability of stored data, which protects us from you from redirecting estimates and possible loss of documents.This is really a unique opportunity to change the approach to education in general, to make it, finally, really continuous. All your achievements, certificates, diplomas, work places and internships will be in the system.If you doubt that there will ever be a university in the system, do not worry. The system is designed in such a way that in the future, completely eliminate such educational institutions from education in general.This is ensured as follows. Each participant of the system, as they say, can trust specific educational institutions, increasing their overall rating. Accordingly, other participants can either trust, for example, the same school or tutor, or vote for another. Thus, the system excludes the possibility of winding up ratings and a general rating, since it is advantageous for the project participants to have an honest rating.I did not just mention the tutors. The developers of Disciplina.io reasonably suggest that their system will attract not only large players. Moreover, it is assumed that several small participants will be merged into educational pools, which will also lead to qualitative changes in the education system.What else? Having on hand or in another way in Disciplina.io all the information about yourself, it is much easier for you to get a job, because the employer, also registered in the system, will trust your certificates and diplomas a priori more than the person who came to the side with a pile of papers .Oh yes. Thanks to Disciplina.io, recruiting agencies will be able to independently find suitable employees without any problems, checking information about a potential employee in the system, and not where the employee himself wrote about himself.Such a project is really a chance to try to change the world around us. It is important to understand that this is a bold experiment, which, it seems to me, can and should find its supporters and investors. The idea or even a few ideas combined here is a great asset for a good start to the project.Terms of the Project:Coins distribution:Team of the Project:Links:SITE: https://disciplina.io/WHITEPAPER: https://disciplina.io/WhitePaper_eng.pdfONEPAGER: https://disciplina.io/pres-eng.pdfTECHNICALPAPER: https://disciplina.io/yellowpaper.pdfANN: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2325715BOUNTY: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3101698.0FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/tchmpls.events/TWITTER: https://twitter.com/tchmpls_eventsTELEGRAM: https://t.me/tchmplsINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tchmpls.events/YOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdRWnzR6WWEiaQlVqGHwOpgGITHUB: https://github.com/serokell/disciplina
