1) Why you invested in Storiqa?Blockchain is the advanced technology which is in initial stage of adoption. Investing in technologies in earlier stages is most profitable and also you help in itâ€™s development. There is no field where blockchain cannot be used. Amazon went to public issue when I was 3 years old, so I never had a chance to invest there. But now storiqa (the second chance I got to invest in a disrupting market place). So why will I stop myself from investing in such a disrupting project?2) What was your first impression of the company?With advanced Blockchain technology on e-commerce business, as a first entrant Storiqa have more time to research, more resources to use and moreover to disrupt the way the e-commerce used to be with quality reviews, shipping, etc.3) Give us advice for the future (What you will do if you were CEO of Storiqa)I see many community members dissatisfied with no new exchanges. May be I will try to list on small good exchanges like Cobinhood, Yobit (where there is no listing fee). Also I will be more explanatory in roadmap mentioning the countries which we will enter.
