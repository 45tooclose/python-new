MoneyRebel — completely different from TenX, Monaco, Revolut and N26, and yet similar to all of them combined, with upgraded functionalities on top!Mobile and online smart banking is exploding with new features, and banks and projects such as N26, Revolut, TenX and Monaco have already stirred up users’ expectations and set new standards. So how will MoneyRebel spice up the financial and banking industry revolution?It turns out these banks and platforms are all top players in their own respective fields. And yet none of them is an all-in-one financial platform, and none offer a marketplace of advisors like MoneyRebel does. At the same time, MoneyRebel retains most of the functionalities of the rest of them!Crypto revolutionTenXBoth MoneyRebel and TenX offer crypto wallets and card payments from crypto accounts –TenX is famous for enabling you to spend your virtual currencies anytime, anywhere, through a simple payment card with both payment and ATM withdrawal functionality, all supported by a mobile app for overview.In addition to that, MoneyRebel offers so many extra functionalities, that it’s almost meaningless to count them all.MonacoSimilar to TenX, Monaco offers a metal payment VISA card to holders of their MCO tokens, one that enables ATM withdrawals and payments and is supported by a mobile app where more than 200 tokens can be tracked and invested into. Hold, spend and exchange multiple currencies, they say, including Bitcoin and Ethereum.MoneyRebel does all that — and in addition, it offers robo and live crypto and fiat advisory services, a financial overview, AI-based recommendations for investment and earning, and a wide array of financial information sources you can rely on for optimal financial portfolio management.Fiat currency basedRevolutRevolut is another big name, a company that successfully revolutionised how people track their expenditure. They do offer crypto purchases, but they do not offer private crypto wallets. They do provide extremely easy money conversion, expense reports and payments with payment cards — but still, the crypto currency purchased is not their own, and it instead resides in the wallet of Revolut, the company. This means that you can only sell your crypto funds through Revolut.MoneyRebel does include numerous functionalities similar to Revolut, but also has the additional perks of private crypto wallets for personal crypto fund safety, card payments from crypto accounts, advisor tools, robo advisors and virtual assistants, as well as enhanced savings returns with crypto arbitrage.N26When it comes to traditional fiat money services, the N26 direct mobile bank is the most visible new player in the market. They have made it easy to open a bank account remotely from throughout Europe, and they are already aiming for the USA market as well. When it comes to their services, they offer easy money conversion, basic multi-currency fiat accounts, expense reports and smart budgeting, and even a limited loans and overdraft plans, as well as fiat card payments with cash-back programs.Still, MoneyRebel, when the Smart Mobile Banking part is built, can easily surpass it in its functionality, offering robo and live advisory services, portfolio management, crypto wallets and functionalities, intelligent investment planning and overnight investment opportunities, all while providing investment recommendations and analysis in real time.Market & competitionAs Bill Gates once said — we all need banking, but soon we won’t need banks to do it!
