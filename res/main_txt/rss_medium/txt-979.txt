We’re Live on New Cosmos TestnetMythos is now live on the Cosmos Gaia-5000 testnet. This is an important step on the road to mainnet release as it’s the first time a Mythos validator has been able to test Cosmos block rewards (currently targeted between 7% to 20% annually).Mythos Validator on Gaia-5000 TestnetTwo weeks from today, we expect the Cosmos team to roll out a testnet update that will include HSM (Hardware Security Module) support which is an essential enhancement for secure key management on the Mythos validator.Insights from latest testnet:Staking economics implemented on testnet (reward range 7% to 20%)Added ability to delegate to / unbound from a validatorTestnet now using latest Cosmos SDK and Tendermint CoreVoyager Wallet interface still not active on TestnetSo when will Cosmos Launch?“It’s getting close,” said Adrian Brink Core Developer when asked about launch date for the Cosmos Hub during our validator call today.Gaia 5000 is the second to last Testnet before Cosmos Hub launch. Unofficial predictions from Cosmos community are holding May or June as possible months for Cosmos launch. Of course, if the network doesn’t launch in May we expect Jae Kwon to be sporting a shaved head and new tattoo.Right now there’s no way for our delegates to test our services, but make sure you sign up so you’re ready to delegate and don’t miss anything.P.S. We’re currently tracking Cosmos progress on support for Ledger Nano S. You may want to pick one up early to be ready to securely delegate with Mythos.
