The team provide organisations with business intelligence products that are created using highly-validated user data. Users choose to share the data created by their activities then receive a portion of the revenue generated from its sale.Normally, users have little control over what data is collected about them and how it is used, and they are usually not compensated for what they provide. Data is necessary to drive innovation, but only low quality and fractured data is available to everyone; high quality data is siloed in big tech and multinational companies.Customers that purchase Biotron products benefit from analytics data that flows directly from users. Thus enabling their organisation to gain deep insights for marketing, innovation, and R&D.Users anonymously contribute data from a variety of sources and services (e.g. online services, social networks, sensors, Internet of Things devices, and more) and have complete control over what data is harvested. They receive cryptocurrency in return at an amount depending on the contribution of their data.BTRN token enables trade of data between data consumers and providers.
