Students Mining Crypto-currencies using Universities’ ElectricitySo, we’ve all heard of people who mine for crypto-currencies; many are even doing this themselves on small scale mining rigs set up their office, basement, garage or any other nook. It seems like a relatively hands-off way to make some extra cash, but the problem comes in when all the work is done. Many people spend thousands on their rigs only to find that, once they’re up and running, costs shoot through the roof. Electrical costs, for example, is one of the prime deterrents for mining.Some are able to compensate for the electrical payments through their mining, but it still cuts out a major portion of their profit. It may deter some people, yet crypto-currency mining enthusiasts aren’t giving up so easily. Instead miners like, Alex Gilarde, are searching for alternative ways to reduce costs for their rigs.Gilarde is a senior at Fairleigh Dickison University. He rigged up his own crypto-currency mining far before the crypto-market was on a high-rise. He reserved around $5,000 dollars for his mining equipment and has multiplied his investment several times in mined Bitcoin. Being an enthusiast, Gilarde has set up rigs in his dorm room, leaving the electrical bills to his university, and cutting off the extra payments that would otherwise detract from his own profits.Not exactly pleased, a spokesperson has announced that the code “prohibits activity that incurs additional cost to the University” and “blocks the mining of cryptocurrency at the firewall level”, but it seems there was no ground to stand on in the university’s written policies.With the rise of crypt-currency mining across the globe and many looking to take advantage of cutting costs, it seems universities may be considering changing their policies on free-electricity. There’s no telling what other changes crypto-currency will spark around the world.
