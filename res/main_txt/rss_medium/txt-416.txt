The “Black Woman’s Guide to Crypto & Blockchain” is taking a seat on @TheStartupBusOnly one month into launching the “Black Woman’s Guide to Crypto and Blockchain”, we are thrilled to be selected to hit the road with the amazing Startup Bus! The StartupBus is an annual competition designed to empower the tech community.This Friday, we’ll board a bus with 20+ women in New York, and we’ll have 72 hours to conceive, build, and launch a blockchain startup. All the while, making our way to New Orleans, (and our Conductor, Colleen has promised surprises along the way, like many entrepreneurship journeys) where will we compete with 9 other buses and pitch the startup we built for a chance to win amazing resources to take that startup to the next level. The @StartupBus team has 9 years worth of experience combining the energy of a hackathon and the magic of a road trip, and this year, giving us 20+ women passionate about blockchain technology– the ultimate adventure on wheels.“This year, the New York bus will be the first-ever StartupBus exclusively for women⁺ and gender non-conforming folks. Better yet, we’re making HERSTORY by pushing our riders to leverage the power of blockchain technology.”The “Black Woman’s Guide to Crypto and Blockchain” exists to empower Black women interested in shaping the future of blockchain technology and crypto-assets — this opportunity is exactly what we advocate for, so we are honored to be selected.So, why a woman-focused Blockchain bus?Well…“There are some incredibly talented and successful women in the Blockchain community already doing amazing things. However, at most industry events you still see a more male dominated environment. In fact, a recent survey revealed that women make up just 1.76% of the blockchain community. Blockchain is one of the most disruptive technologies we have ever experienced, so we want to encourage more women to get involved and lead the way in shaping its future.” -Daria Arefieva, CEO of CryptoFriendsWe are so excited to meet fellow crypto and blockchain enthusiasts and build a solution that has the potential to positively impact women and girls around the world.We are able to attend thanks to the Diversity Scholarship offered by the @TheStartupBus and the Black Women Blockchain Council is actively fundraising to help cover the remaining travel expenses for Black women joining the inaugural bus, we’d live your support (hotel, food and return flight).
