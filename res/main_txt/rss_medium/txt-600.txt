Blockchain Assists Non-Profit OrganizationsWhether it is raising awareness about our environment, feeding children in developing countries, or operating local food banks, non-profits are working tirelessly throughout our society to contribute to global charity. The difficulty for non-profit organizations often lies in funding and donations. Billionaire corporations, like Google and Microsoft, are gifting large portions of money to non-profits throughout all sectors, but the difficulty comes with trust.Oftentimes, fundraising a non-profit is a tricky business because donors are anxious to know where their money is going and what it is contributing to, as well as how much is going directly to the cause. In recent years, there has not been much of a solution to track this exchange, instead companies are often forced to rely solely on the word of the non-profit. Up until now it has seemed there is no solution.With all that blockchain is doing to increase efficiency with for-profit corporations, it comes as no surprise that the system is intervening in yet another industry. With its cutting-edge way of tracking, blockchain is returning trust to the non-profit sector. No more relying on the word of the foundation, donors can now track exactly what their money is being used for and how much is going to the cause. This helps greatly in rooting out less than efficient non-profits and allows ones that are actually accomplishing their goal to thrive on more funding and increased trust.Cryptocurrency donations may seem like a far reach into the future, but it is already in place and many are applying it. The future of non-profit organizations?Full trust, and full transparency.And, a more efficient means of charity across the globe.
