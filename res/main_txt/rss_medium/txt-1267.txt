Interesting article but disappointing to XRP holders..your explanation is quite interesting but even if we claim all competitors came with the same technology I can see ripple lab has far made more logistic partners with different part of the world financial institutions andforsee good market opportunity that had great ROI at least for the coming few yearsÂ . In prospective point of view the hard news for Ripple in the market would come not in few upcoming years coz adoption is happening now but maybe in the future.
