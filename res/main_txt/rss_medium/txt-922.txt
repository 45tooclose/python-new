CREATING A MORE REALISTIC WORLDThe gaming world is getting more realistic with the emergence and integration of the Blockchain technology. The Blockchain and Smart contract technology has made it possible to shift the old gaming paradigm from “pay-to-play” “free-to-play” to “earn-to-play” in order to enhance gaming experience in this contemporary world.The idea of earning real money in gaming is not new to the gaming industry but there has been some bars which limit the full realization of this innovative idea. Almost all the problems hindering the actualization of this idea stem from the archaic existing payment system which is built on a centralized model. Some of the shortcomings are:Prolong payment transactionFraud issuesHigh cost per transactionNo transparency in data transactionGlobal transfer feeLack of connection between different gamesThird party game item trading sites like the ItemBay in Korea has been one of the avenues for gamers to trade hard earned game items for real money but the question is, “Are the other game item trading sites legit to do transactions with?” Gamers end up being scammed due to the lack of proper security in the market place.Also, the old payment system is subjected to delays and third party organizations control which can decide to halt or stop a transaction.Gamers are faced with the fate of not being able to transfer hard earned game items to different games to enhance more fun in their gaming experience.After a thorough scan of the gaming industry, Yumerium took upon its shoulders to utilize the Blockchain technology and spearhead the movement of the gaming industry to another light of tremendous fun-and-earn model.
