Loandex: A Brief OverviewLoandex is the future of decentralized cryptocurrency exchange platform. We respect our users’ privacy and we do not intend to be intrusive, this is why we created a platform without the Know Your Customer (KYC) model. Here is a brief run through of what we are about:The exchange platform will be created to function on different platforms, with the availability of over 10 coins at the launch.Selection of other currencies to be listed on the Loandex exchange will be through a poll. Users will vote via a poll for the coin they want to get listed on the exchange.No other decentralized exchange offers margin trading, hence, we are the first decentralized exchange to offer that.Our team consists of seasoned developers and security analysts, with vast knowledge in diverse areas, including blockchain technology and software engineering.When the Loandex exchange begins full operation, there will be 4 base-currency trading pairs involving BTC, LTC, ETH, and LDX.Traders using the LDX market pairs will enjoy free trading on the platform, and for pairs involving ETH, BTC, and LTC market pairs, a 0.05% fee will be charged, which will be used for logistics and maintenance expenses only.There is a token used to operate the platform referred to as the Loandex token (LDX), and its value will appreciate within months, because it will be the only currency allowed for payments of any of our services on the system, and also to pay charges.The Loandex exchange has powerful servers that are able to handle over 120 million visitors each month.There is a burning program where each vote made during the poll to get coins listed will attract a fee of 0.1 LDX, then the amount of tokens paid for the voting automatically gets sent to the burn address. To increase the token value, burned tokens will have a buy-back.
