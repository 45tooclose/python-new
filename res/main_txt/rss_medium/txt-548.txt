Ethereum Ecosystem To See New Tech To Solve ScalingThere is something new on the horizon for the Ethereum blockchain network which might just resolve the issue of scaling for the second largest cryptocurrency in the world. The inspiration for the name of this new technology comes from Slavic mythos — namely Perun — the god of lightening.The new tech which has been researched on by a group of researchers that are based in Warsaw, Poland takes its inspiration from the lightening network that Bitcoin is making use of. A new white paper has been released by the researchers based in Poland which has been given the title “Foundation of State Channel Networks”. This new white paper proposes a new protocol which can possibly help the Ethereum blockchain network to improve on its scaling and become capable of facilitating smart contracts that are more sophisticated than they are right now.Difference In Approach To OthersThis is not to say that Perun is the only approach being taken to come to a resolution for the Ethereum blockchain network’s scaling problem, it’s just that the manner in which Perun is approaching the problem is different. The focus that this new technology has is on the security aspect of the protocol.Read More: https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/04/ethereum-ecosystem-see-new-tech-solve-scaling/
