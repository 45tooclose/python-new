THE WINNER TAKES PHOTO AND MAKES MONEYThere is a saying “The first step is always the hardest”. Though it’s even harder, when you have already made that very first step, to make people follow you. But if the idea is solid and worth to follow, the first followers gain the most.In 2008 Satoshi Nakamoto integrated many existing ideas from the cypherpunk community and has created bitcoin. On the 5th of October you could buy 1309.03 BTC for only $1. There is a living example of gaining very much thanks to being among the first ones.Back in 2009, Koch was working on a thesis paper about encryption, which introduced him to the relatively unknown world of Bitcoin. He decided for fun to throw down $27 for 5,000 Bitcoins because the encryption process fascinated him and because why not. Koch then promptly forgot about the purchase — until Bitcoin started popping up in the news four years later, that is.Remembering his offhand investment in 2013, Koch searched for the password to his wallet and was overwhelmed to find that, he was sitting on an $886,000 nest egg. After trading in just one-fifth of his total purchase, he was able to buy himself an apartment in Toyen, one of the wealthiest areas in Oslo. Christopher’s girlfriend went back on her word about the pointlessness of cryptocurrency as well ;-)So, let me kindly remind you that it’s a sound decision to join our social platform right now, at the starting line.
