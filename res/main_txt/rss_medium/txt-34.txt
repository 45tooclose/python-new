In case Bitcoin or Ether decrease their value, the USD 9.00 mark will secure the token Settlement Value.For more information, see: https://www.wawllet.com/Facebook — https://www.facebook.com/wawlletTwitter — https://twitter.com/wawlletLinkedIn — https://www.linkedin.com/company/25065101/Reddit — https://www.reddit.com/search?q=wawlletTelegram — https://t.me/joinchat/BA0ARkOA92RV7dNxwfKmng
