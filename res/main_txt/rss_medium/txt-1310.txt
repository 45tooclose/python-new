As for example, you bought TRX with price 0.00000433btc. But you ain’t sure that price will go high soon, or you think that something will happened for cryptos with bad news incoming. That’s why you set stoploss for TRX, with price for selling 0.00000400btc. You need to set “stop” with price which is a bit high then “limit” price. So, in this example we set “stop” 402satoshi, and limit 400satoshi. So “stop” is when system will put your order to the selling cup and “limit” is the price with which the system will sell your coins in case to warn against future losses in the market.
