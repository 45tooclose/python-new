Collectively Mr. Youssefian’s businesses have brought in more than 15 Million USD in annual revenue.During a recent press conference, Mr. Youssefian, Founder and CEO of JustHive was quoted as saying,“Social media is broken. It was created to promote fun, create connections, and build friendships. Today, it’s a source of anxiety and depression. It’s an invasion of privacy, and a cause of concern. JustHive wants to change all of that by providing a safe and fun platform for people to come together in accessible community forums. It’s fun, friendly, and easy, just like it should be. We believe that it is these core values that will make our ICO successful for the long term!”The ICO Pre-Sale for this highly anticipated ICO is currently live.
