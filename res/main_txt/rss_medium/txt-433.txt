INTRODUCTIONThere is revolution going on in the world, affecting a lot of areas and health is not an exception. Genomics and blockchain technology are dedicated to significantly improve health and well-being in the world. Genomic medicine enables us to understand and treat a wide range of diseases including chronic ones. Blockchain technology will transform both the future of healthcare and the world economy. Shivom is the best way to bring these two technologies together, to move the world to higher levels.Shivom offers patients and genome data donors the opportunity to have their genome sequenced and securely stored and also provide pharmaceuticals, research organizations, governments, patient-support groups and insurance companies to add their apps and services.This means only patients can have access to their genomic data which they can either share or sell for profit.Blockchain technology has been chosen for this project because it is able to address trust issues, including patient consent, data ownership, data integrity, and authentication. It is also able to manage complex data rights and allow fine-grained access using smart contracts.Shivom has a lot of benefits which includes; donors gaining rewards for sharing their genomic data to institutions, pharmaceutical companies being able to refine drug development, patients obtaining personalized health, well-being, and lifestyle information. The cost of DNA sequencing has fallen significantly and possibly, by the end of the decade it will be possible to generate a person’s entire genome for less than $100 which will further decline.1	Genomic sequencing has a wide range of benefits which includes, identifying the best course of care for patients with a particular condition, prediction of disease risk, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease, disease prognosis and identifying new drug targets.2	Blockchain technology helps users transmit genomic data or quantifiable lifestyle information to other stakeholders whiles withholding sensitive information.When conducting clinical trials, only a small population size is used and even some of the patients will not respond to treatment. Shivom makes it possible to identify the population that will benefit most from the treatment hence it helps to save cost and time.Shivom will also benefit pharmaceutical companies because they will have access to high quality data from patients so their drugs can be produced at high quality.We aim to build a global network of genetic counsellors who can also form a telemedicine ecosystem, hence not only those with genetic risks will benefit. Our counsellors and laboratories will provide up to date information to patients.Genomic data acquisition has been increasing tremendously.THE OmiX TOKENThe OmiX token enables buying, trading, incentivizing and other services in the Shivom ecosystem. It provides the ability to: acquire premium services in the Shivom ecosystem, genome sequencing kits, sponsor sequencing projects, gain access to health or fitness apps, access the genome database, pay donors for data or participation in research studies and pay service providers to use the platform.90M OmiX Tokens will be distributed to the community to grow and nurture the Shivom ecosystem, for bounty programs to reward developers, entrepreneurs, and strategists.420M OmiX will be used to support the development of the Shivom ecosystem 300M OmiX will be given to early backers and advisors.600M OmiX will be as rewards for data generation. 600M OmiX will be kept by the Foundation as a reserve fund for future data contribution, running the Foundation and associated non-profit R&D efforts.USE OF PROCEEDSOUR COMPETENT TEAM MEMBERSDr. Axel SchumacherCo-Founder & CEOPh.D. in Genetics, over 20 years of R&D leadership experience in genomics, epigenetics, biomarker discovery, Bio-IT, aging & longevity.Gourish SinglaCo-Founder & COOSerial Entrepreneur.
