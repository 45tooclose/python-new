Boost GTX 1080 and GTX 1080 Ti hashrate to 54 MH/s while Mining EthereumWalkthrough video on how to use OhGodAnETHlargementPillSo I stumbled on a new tool called OhGodanETHlargementPill which apparently can boost your hashrate dramatically on the GTX 1080, GTX 1080 Ti and Titan Xp NVIDIA video cards. I decided to try out the tool to see if it would in fact boost my current hashrate of 37 MH/s (overclocked) to the supposed 50 MH/s that they claim.GTX 1080 Ti in my crypto mining rigMy mining rig is equipped with two GTX 1080 Ti video cards. My current hashrate on each card, without the OhGodanETHlargmentPill tool running is about 37.4 MH/s while mining Ethereum using the Claymore miner on ethermine.org. Below you can see my overclock settings and current temperatures in MSI Afterburner.Overclock settingsStart my downloading the tool here on Github, and unzip it. The tool is pretty simple to use, simply run Claymore miner and then run the OhGodAnETHlargmentPill-r2 application by right clicking and running as an administrator.Once you start the tool, you should immediately see a boost in your hashrate. Mine went from 37 Mh/s up to 54 MH/s!50+ MH/sI was curious to know if the hashrate would be reflected in Ethermine. I left Claymore miner and the tool running for almost 24 hours, and below you can see a screenshot of the going hashrate and shares in Ethermine.So how does this tool work? I made a video explaining the whole setup process and a subscriber left a comment on how the tool is capable of achieving the high hash rate.What this fix does? Nvidia’s flagship gpu´s 1080, 1080ti and Titan XP use a faster memory called gddr5x. Only Micron manufactures these memories and they have high bandwidth and speed. This has not helped in mining, since the memory timings does not match the algo. Particularly the GTX1080 has performed badly in respect to ether mining hash / price of gpu. This fix re-arranges the timing so that these gddr5x memories get the correct timings and thus the hashrates increase to the level they should have set from the beginning. So now, especially the GTX1080 and 1080ti have gone from not-so-good to really good performance. There will be almost no increase in power-draw, neither should you see any jump up in temp. Keep mining!-Fat ManSo is this something I will continue to run? I will be using it for the next few days to see how much Ethereum I can earn each day, and if it is equivalent or more than what I earn mining Equihash coins on Mining Pool Hub, then I will continue to use it. As of right now with less than 24 hours of mining, it’s hard to tell if this is something I would run in the long term. I will be posting an update to this project in the next few days on my YouTube channel.
