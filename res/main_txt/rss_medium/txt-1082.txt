Phase 2: “Proof of Freedom” Favorites (So Far)We were amazed at the entries in our Crowdgift Phase 2: “Proof of Freedom”. That #MainframeForFreedom hashtag shows some incredible work in so much more variety than we anticipated.This this video, Mick and Austin got together to share some of their favorite entries so far, though official judging is ongoing among our whole team. We’re feverishly racing through the mountain of entries while trying to not overlook the more subtle work. It’ll take some time, but we’ll have final results to you all in the very near future.We’ll also share individual entries across our social channels for a long time to come.Thanks again, everyone. This is about more than some pictures and videos on Twitter. I think we’re seeing the beginning of a vibrant community of creative, capable, engaged people who care deeply about privacy, security, and individual sovereignty in the digital age. It’s something I’m proud to be part of.
