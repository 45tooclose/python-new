Soundeon Steps Closer to Revolutionizing the Music Business With New Patent-Pending TechnologySoundeon firms its position as a technological maverick within the music industry as it files to patent underlying technology.We continue to gain momentum and establish Soundeon position at the forefront of blockchain innovation as our inventors have filed a nonprovisional utility patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on April 27 for the Creative Smart Contract™ technology underlying the platform.The patent-pending Creative Smart Contract™ environment provides novel systems and methods for intellectual property ownership rights management, funding and ticketing on the blockchain and peer-to-peer. Artists have full control of their creative output from the very inception to the copyright, distribution, royalty collection and distribution of the intellectual property works as well as event ticketing.This is accomplished through the utilization of decentralized stores and a series of smart, self-executing contracts; collectively integrating a number of systems and methods into a single environment intended to vertically integrate the media rights management and ticketing industries. The use-case of this technology extends to all types of intellectual property.“Our breakthrough technology encapsulates not only digital rights management but the entire life-cycle of an artist, including funding, IP marketplace, DRM, micro-payment channels and ticketing on the distributed ledger. Soundeon’s holistic approach to utilizing blockchain technology and IPFS goes well beyond the patchy patents filed by the likes of Sony who are so far taking an outdated approach to blockchain technology,” said Vladimir Avdeev, CVO of Soundeon.Artists now have the ability to stay out of reach of the tentacles of the conventional music business launched by record labels, managers, agents and other middlemen.Patent-pending status provides Soundeon and its users with intellectual property protection for its leading-edge approach to resolving media rights management. Users can now be assured that the Creative Smart Contract™ technology will remain accessible to everyone and that no other company on the market can interfere with this original intention.Soundeon’s Aram Abgaryan provides a technical overview of the Platform’s layers at the blockchain summit.___________________________________________________________________If you would like to keep an eye on our project, follow us on Facebook or Twitter.
