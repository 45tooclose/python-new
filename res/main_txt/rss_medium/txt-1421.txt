Thank you for keeping us posted! Honestly many of us don’t know the “behind the scene stuff” that goes on with regards to distributing bounty tokens. I hope this article would shed some light to the community, especially to bounty hunters about the intricacies involved in the distribution process. My compliments to Daneel team, especially to the bounty manager and community manager.
