This has caused great concern that someone could be targeted, and have their wallets emptied in a targeted hack because their wallets where not transparent and the hacker followed a large transaction over the blockchain. This lack of privacy has also lead to scammers getting a large foothold targeting people, with too good to be true stories and opportunities.Why Choose Kryptonium?Kryptonium offers a unique and usable utility, that has been designed to provide real world benefits to adopters from every walk of life.
