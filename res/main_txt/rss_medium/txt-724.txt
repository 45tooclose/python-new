Industry in Review: Correction, Causation & CorrelationRepresentative HuizengaRecently during a session entitled “Oversight of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance” (available below), varying opinions were shared regarding ICO regulations and oversight changes as they could be applied to the industry within the United States specific markets.Hearing entitled "Oversight of the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance" | House Committee on…Edit descriptionfinancialservices.house.govAs Chairman for the US Committee on Financial Services, Mr Huizenga introduces the hearing with the following statement:“One of my biggest concerns is the declining number of public companies which has led to fewer investment opportunities for mainstreet investors.”Huizenga goes on to explain that it is his belief that the changes in the economy have continued to strengthen the US Economy, but have likewise led to decreasing investment positive reception due to the “…one size fits all Securities Regulations currently in place.” The key point of his introduction is explained to be the need and priority for increasing foundational capital markets creation for the greater good of citizens within Michigan (Rep. Huizenga’s home state) and for the entire country as a whole.In regards to the decline in activity of Initial Public Offerings (IPO’s) in the United States, Huizenga asks William Hinman if the uptrend in ICO’s could possibly the cause. Hinman goes on to respond:“in theory, there is a time when a coin may achieve a decentralized utility in the marketplace, or […] there may be coins where that lack of a central actor may make it difficult to regulate.”However, Hinman agreed that the digital landscape of ICO’s and the industry they are sourced from continues to change with time. Regarding regulation, he states:“We are striving for a balanced approach, and one that ensures capital formation while maintaining a strong focus on investor protection.”Many US lawmakers and legislators alike have continued to show a wildly different opinion and approach to the blockchain industry. As noted by Virginia Senator Mark Warner last February, during the highly reported Senate Hearing in reference to cryptocurrency markets:Senator Mark Warner“I think we may be on top of something that’s transformational, and I don’t think you can separate the underlying, distributed-ledger blockchain from some of these crypto assets,” Warner argued. “If we had the same rate of increase the next two years that we’ve had the last couple [of] years, we’re talking now a couple hundred billion, we’d be at north of 20 trillion dollars caught up in this area by 2020.”Warner went on to describe the blockchain industry innovation to that of the cellphone market influx in the early 80's:“I remember back, I was lucky enough to get in the cell phone business back in the early 80s and everybody thought it was going to be a small business,” Warner said. “And, they were wrong, and I got rich. I think we’re looking at the same kind of transformation about to take place, and we are going to have to wrap our arms around it.”
