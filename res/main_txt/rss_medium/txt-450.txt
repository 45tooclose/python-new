Nauticus — top world-class trading platform with the support of the Australian state regulator AUSTRAC, PayPal and Western Union, top KYC protection methods, as well as its own ASIC miners and integration with the world’s online stores.Currently, the majority of investors and traders when entering fiat on the exchange, as well as exchanging tokens and withdrawing cash, lose a decent amount on the commission. These new global problems will be solved by the new Australian Exchange Nauticus exchange where 300 currencies will be traded, as well as entering and withdrawing in 16 international currencies with a commission of 0.1%. The project is registered in the regulated harbor by the Australian regulator AUSTRAC. More than 200,000 thousand users have already registered themselves on the platform and are waiting for the launch of the project. Users will be able to directly input and output via PayPal and Western Union in combination, but with a large number lower tariffs and rates of the live market.FOR WHICH PLAYERS OF THE FINANCIAL MARKET THE PLATFORM, AND ITS FUNDAMENTAL AND TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTSThe platform will provide access to physical, legal, as well as governmental organizations. Nauticus provides convenient, efficient and secure encryption, payments and e-commercesolutions using blockchain technology, backed by the Nauticus coin. Similarly, as the road map progresses in 2019, it will introduce a stable blockchain that will allow it to mine blocks. The profit from the sale will be aimed at improving the platform. The main goal of the project team is to create the best loyalty system among all crypto-exchange communities and to give everyone an opportunity to earn. Also, the company develops a modern verification (“KYC”) verification, which will maximize the optimization and security, as well as create a community in which only real users will be. Platform NAUTICUS will work on the most popular devices. When exchanging crypto currency within the platform, the user will receive an intermediate Nauticus, since it provides 50% reduction of trade commissions. At work and creation of a purse the algorithm of versioning by a voice, the person, and as a print of fingers will be used. There will also be a system of hot and cold wallets. All users will be manually checked by the project team, as well as active backup of all transactions using a hyper-ledger. 90–95% of all funds will be stored offline, under reliable protection, as the project team attracted communities for cyber security of the banking sector. For active traders, it will be possible to connect the metatrader and trade with the help of trading robots. The platform will also allow you to connect the world’s Internet sites and provide users directly to buy things without withdrawing money from the exchange.PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE KEY TECHNICAL FEATURES, AND THE SAME TECHNICAL OPPORTUNITIESA high-performance platform is built on the basis of StreamDB, which leads to the possibility of improvement through modules. Nauticus is built from scratch, in order to make the system check for errors and write the data to the restor for the subsequent elimination of errors in operation.CORE SYSTEMS COMPONENTSThe order number of orders equals one million per second. For such a number of orders for use, a multi-system (OMS) will be applied, which is aimed at regulating the status of the application. Such a system will allow Nauticus to be linked to other platforms and exchange.Risk Management System that implements a wide range of limits and controls on order entry, execution, and settlement.BLOCKCHAIN MININGAntimaner S9 model will be used for the production of the token. In the future, its ASIC algorithm will be created which will speed up production, as well as reduce economic and environmental costs. It is expected that the center will start functioning in 2019. Mines with equipment will be installed in the territory of the poor countries, which will allow to obtain a double benefit using technical equipment in philanthropic activities. The company set a target price for energy from 3 to 8 cents per kWh, which is easily achievablebased on existing market research. An object with 15,000 machines will generate revenue in the amount of $ 31 million. This income will help expand the business of Nauticus.My markThe project is the best stock exchange that is presently, as the ecosystem has included support for the world’s financial systems, as well as support for the state financial regulator. In addition, its technology will be developed, as well as interaction with developing countries, which will significantly expand the horizon of opportunities. Modern, modular blockhain will avoid mistakes and will attract both the professional community and large investment funds who prefer to keep their assets in a safe place. I really liked the project, because loyalty is placed on the most important place. I was also impressed by the future integration of the world’s Internet sites, where you can make payments without payments directly from the platform! 47 developers, as well as a large number of top-level partners will raise the project to the skies. Proet at me causes the most positive emotions, as he the first could agree with world regulators. All this will make it the first, top-priority project on the territory of Australia and the surrounding areas, creating its own unique financial harbor where everyone will find savings, and a way to multiply their investments.I give the project 5 out of 5 balls, it really deserves such an assessment!Token sale31.03.18–28.05.181 NTC = 0.00001 BTCTotal token supply 2.500.000.000Road mapThe road map will end in 2023Team & Advisor47 peopleOfficial Web Page https://www.nauticus.io/ • White Paper https://storage.googleapis.com/assets-nauticus-platform/NauticusWhitepaperOfficial.pdf • Facebook https://www.facebook.com/NauticusBlockchain/ • Twitter https://twitter.com/nauticusen • Telegram https://t.me/nauticusblockchain_________________________________________________________________Author: novikov433Bitcointalk profile: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1043836https://www.linkedin.com/in/artsiom-novikau-458138151/SteemitThe latest posts from novikov433.
