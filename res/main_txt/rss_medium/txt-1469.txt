Brickblock ICO review | JOIN THE REVOLUTION OF ASSET TOKENIZATIONTokenizing $250+ trillion worth of real-world assets with a secure and regulatory compliant framework.Brickblock is building a new blockchain-based solution for investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), real estate funds (REFs), passive coin-traded funds (CTFs) and active coin managed funds (CMFs). Through the effective use of smart contracts, order and issuing fees can be reduced to a fraction of traditional costs. This will make investing in Brickblock more financially inclusive across all income classes. Artificial geographical trading restrictions, including the need for a bank account, can thus be eliminated. Counterparty risk can be reduced to mere minutes. Furthermore, we are introducing a new system of passively managed cryptocurrency baskets, which reduces the risks and high fees of actively managed coin funds by using liquidity providers, incentivized by arbitrage effects. Our system is based on an underlying rule-based asset allocation rather than high-risk contracts for difference (CFDs). It uses the asset-first principle, which incentivizes asset vendors to deliver assets before getting paid, thus further reducing investor risk.Token Sell Stage 3 of ICO started on May 9th, 2018Sale duration: 7 daysJoin now: https://www.brickblock.ioBRICKBLOCK WHITEPAPERS
