Watch Out For ScamsWe are sharing this post written by our community member Joey Kheireddine (github.com/joeykhd) and posted by him on FUSIONs subreddit.‘FSN is growing bigger and bigger by the day and it is backed by a beautiful community. Unfortunately not all people have good intensions, please be aware of the following scams:A person using an admins name messaging you asking if you want to invest more and if you could send them ETH. Please note, The ICO is over and you can only purchase FSN on exchanges. Please, block this person and report the name to one of the admins so this username can be banned from the Telegram group.Imposters replying to Fusion’s Twitter saying: Send 0.2 ETH and receive 2 ETH. Ofcourse, this is fake. And you will get scammed. Always remember, there is no such thing as free money. And if it’s too good to be true, it usually is.Airdrop? There is no Fusion Airdrop! Those scammers will ask you to fill in your privatekey to receive the so called airdrop. You will get robbed! Never ever send your privatekey to anyone and store it in a safe place.’Thanks Joey for the sage advice!
