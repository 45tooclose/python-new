This is case-in-point where the whole “trustless” that everybody refers to with cryptos is complete bullshit. If you aren’t willing to trust a central authority, than you must be willing to trust the protocol creators and the code, its one trust for another. And irony? Most people can’t read code.Out of all the cryptocurrency hodlers out there, about 99.99% of them never even bothered to even browse through the codebase of what their holding to ensure it is what its represented to be. The fact that ZCash is anonymous but only 4% of addresses are stealth addresses is a big yellow flag right now that regardless of how cutting-edge zk-SNARKS is, the vast majority of its benefits is clearly not being utilized.Doesn’t mean ZCash is useless, but they have a ways to go to live up to their proposed use case.
