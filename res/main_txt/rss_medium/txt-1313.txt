Anyone can securely buy & sell everywhere with built-in decentralized reputation, escrow, and dispute resolution.XNK is the underlying currency used in all Ink Protocol transactions. As a result, all transactions and feedback are backed by proof of payment on the blockchain. XNK is also staked in escrow during transactions and earned by mediators for the mediation services that they provide on transactions.​Ink Protocol will transfer the value created in peer-to-peer marketplaces back into the hands of buyers and sellers.

They use this data to charge high fees and lock you into their platform. With Ink Protocol, your reputation becomes portable across marketplaces, and you can transact safely without a central service, allowing you to easily buy and sell everywhere and on any platform.Ink Protocol sold $15MM in a token sale and reached the hard cap in 12 minutes.
