ULLINK Unveils Dedicated Low Latency Connectivity for the ASEAN RegionULLINK and SNAP Innovations collaborationSINGAPORE, 10 November 2017 — ULLINK, a global provider of electronic trading and connectivity solutions to the financial community, today announced availability of a dedicated low latency connectivity offering for Singapore and the broader South-East Asian region. Building on ULLINK’s demonstrated ability to deliver comprehensive connectivity services for local sell-side and buy-side market participants, the new offering more specifically addresses the growing need of local proprietary (“prop”) traders and other firms for a high speed route to regional trading venues.ULLINK benefits from a strong footprint in the region thanks to NYFIX, its award winning low latency order routing network, already used by leading banks and brokers in the region for global connectivity. The NYFIX community numbers more than 1,500 buy-side, sell-side and trading venue members, offering simplified access for firms looking to extend their market reach locally or internationalise their trading activities. In order to better serve the region, ULLINK recently launched dedicated hubs in Asia for optimised regional message routing.With an increasing number of clients moving order flow through low-touch execution channels, the value of low-latency has become vital to the efficiency of trading. The new connectivity offering takes advantage of ULLINK’s co-location facilities at regional exchanges to provide exceptionally fast connectivity for firms supporting DMA and algorithmic trading strategies. ULLINK has also extended its network of regional partners looking to provide low latency market connectivity to their customers, including SNAP Innovations — a local provider of multi-asset algo based trading solutions.“Partnering with a leading firm like ULLINK is a big win for our customers,” said Michael Lim, Director at SNAP Innovations. “Thanks to ULLINK’s easy and fast broker onboarding, we are able to focus on delivering trading solutions for our clients with greatly accelerated time to market, while maintaining the ultra-low latency and security standards we are used to delivering for our clients.”Ofir Gefen, Managing Director Asia Pacific Japan at ULLINK, comments, “We believe a major part of our success as a global player relies on an intensely regional focus, to ensure we continue to meet the needs of our customers at the local level. In the connectivity space, we are dedicated to providing a comprehensive set of services across client connectivity and DMA, in FIX and native protocols, for the wider Asian region. We will continue to invest in improving connectivity, performance and coverage of all our execution technology solutions.”Earlier this month, ULLINK’s NYFIX won Best Low Latency Trading Network for the second year running, in the Waters’ annual Buy-Side Technology Awards. The category acknowledges distinctive capabilities and expertise in trading network provision, including broadness of connectivity and, proximity to market centres and exchanges, as well as ability to manage large volumes without adding unnecessary latency.Source: https://www.ullink.com/ullink-unveils-dedicated-low-latency-connectivity-for-the-asean-region/
