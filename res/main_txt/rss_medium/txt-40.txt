Mike’s weekend message to QUOINE community (April 7th, 2018)Dear QUOINERS,I hope you are having a wonderful weekend.In Japan, April (the cherry blossom season) is the new fiscal year.And it is also the new fiscal year for QUOINE.In May 2014, Mario and I co-founded QUOINE to build the most advanced and secure cryptocurrency exchange in the world. We knew Crypto and Blockchain was the most disruptive innovation since the internet and that it would have a huge social impact by providing financial services to the masses.Since then, there have been numerous booms and busts in the industry but this was expected. The industry will continue to grow and improve everyone’s lives.At QUOINE, our team has grown from 33 people last march to over 207 this march. This is more than 6x. Truly remarkable!!But as we grow, what is going to be most important is to not lose focus. To have shared vision, a culture of respect, to foster entrepreneurial spirit.I always say that we will only be good as our people.We are going to make fiscal 2018–2019 amazing and the ultimate goal is important but the journey is what makes it special.Please enjoy my weekly update.1.
