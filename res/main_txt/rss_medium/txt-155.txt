The Lucidity Whitepaper: New and ImprovedIf you’ve read our whitepaper in the past, I feel the need to apologize.The first versions of our whitepaper were overly complex and difficult to understand.Later versions improved on readability, but didn’t completely describe our protocol and applications as accurately as we would have liked.So we’re very happy to announce that we’ve released an update to our whitepaper. Not only is this version highly digestible, but also describes exactly what we do. In plain English, as always.Find it here.
