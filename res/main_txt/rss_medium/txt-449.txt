Crypto Market Meditations 24th April 2018Coin Market Cap 24th April 2018TLDR;Huge green day for cryptos today with some massive gains. EOS & Tron some of the larger cap coins making massive gains. Market cap added about $30 Billion currently at $434 Billion with Bitcoin dominance dropping to 37.1%. Altcoin season may be under way with Bitcoin dominance taking a big drop today.Top News:16 exchanges in Japan will self-regulateMEW compromisedMalta setting up regulatory framework, attractive for exchangesGoldman Sachs setting up to enter cryptocurrency trading?Bitcoin ($9,487.07, 6.41%) Bitcoin managed to break the heavy resistance at $9000 level about 12:30am UTC. From then, there was a big move up to $9200, and from there a steady climb to $9400. There was a quick drop mid-day to about $9200 with some traders probably capitalising as there was a lot of positive sentiment in the market. There was another drop when the price action reached around $9400 again but price action has now managed to trade above. Due to the current positive sentiment, I will be looking for drops on the 15 minute chart to enter short term longs. I will be closely monitoring both RSI & volume when I feel the price action might take a turn but at the moment I would only be looking at good long entries.$BTCUSD log 1hr chartEthereum ($706.09)Seems like ages since Ethereum has had some life in it but it is actually having some positive price action recently outperforming USD & BTC today. There was a significant resistance level at $700 with price action currently trading above it. If manages to close above it on the daily, monitor volume for an increase which could give it another push upwards.ETHUSD daily log chartLitecoin ($164.32, 8.48%)Next resistance levels around 170 and 178 level but price action is moving with some volume so should at least get through 170. Currently LTC outperforming btc as has been performing more strongly compared to btc when price action is moving upward as of recent. On the other side, it tends to drop further when price action is moving downward. Decent volume today in sync with the overall altcoin market in general. Even, if there is a drop in volume tomorrow, overall sentiment is looking good for pushing the price higher.LTCUSD daily log chartDisclaimer: This is not financial advice, this is for entertainment purposes only.
