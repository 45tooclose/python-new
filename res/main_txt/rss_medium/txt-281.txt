EU Demands Verification of Cryptocurrency OwnersMembers of the European Parliament voted for new anti-money laundering measures including closer control over cryptocurrencies. These measures include closer regulation for virtual currencies to prevent them being used for money laundering and terrorism financing.The new rules deal with prepaid cards and virtual currencies. Its require customer verification for cryptocurrency owners. In a bid to end the anonymity associated with virtual currencies, virtual currency exchange platforms and custodian wallet providers will, like banks, have to apply customer due diligence controls, including customer verification requirements.These platforms and providers will also have to be registered, as will currency exchanges and cheque cashing offices, and trust or company services providers.The agreement represents the fifth and latest update to the EU’s Anti-money laundering Directive and is partly a response to the terrorist attacks of 2015 and 2016 in Paris and Brussels, as well as the Panama Papers leaks. The reforms give citizens the right to access information on the beneficial owners of firms which operate in the EU. An additional measure would also open up data on beneficial owners of trusts and similar arrangements to those who can demonstrate a “legitimate interest”. This would make information on trusts available to investigative journalists and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).
