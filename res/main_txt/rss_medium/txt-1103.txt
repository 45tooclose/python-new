UK Traders Ask the Government to Put Regulations on Cryptocurrency MarketBritish crypto traders are dissatisfied with the current situation on the financial market. They asked the government and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to enact tougher rules for the trade of virtual coins and to certify crypto exchanges that show compliance.According to reports, Iqbal V Gandham, chair of CryptoUK, said:“Introducing a requirement for the FCA to regulate the “on-off” ramps between crypto and fiat currencies is well within the remit of HM Treasury.
