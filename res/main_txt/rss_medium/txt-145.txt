Nonetheless, I am happy to report that this week’s payout had went smoothly, and everyone who accumulated more than 0.3 ARK during this period should have received a payout. If you haven’t received a payment, more than likely you didn’t reach that threshold. So check out your pending balance below:Click into the table then use CTRL + F (Windows) or CMD + F (Mac) to browse through the chart to find your address.If you have any trouble using the following table, and require my help, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Thank you to everyone for the incredible support!Kind regards,DelArk is a voyage, join me and together we will reap the rewards of this great journey.Vote: Del
