StockTwits May 2018 Power Rankings: 10 Stocks You Need To WatchFANG is back, bay-bay!Tech stocks got rocked in recent months. Amazon took a hit after several Trump tweets, and Facebook was blasted after its data breach. But it was only a matter of time before they rallied back, and into the portfolios of pros everywhere.Yet is FANG all that matters anymore?In just five years, FANG went from 3.5% of the S&P 500 to represent over 9% of the index. So, while FANG stocks are featured prominently in this month’s Power Rankings (spoiler: 4 of the 10 stocks on this list are FANG), that still leaves us with several non-FANG-related stocks that you will find interesting.This month’s StockTwits Power Rankings looks at stocks that shined through the darkness during the sell-offs of February, and early April. We focus on how these stocks moved last month (April 2018) and what they could do for months to come.As always, if you still don’t know what the Power Rankings are, or if this is your first time reading, head here and check out our quick guide to understanding the Power Rankings.10. Callaway Golf ($ELY) % in AprilWho knew? One of the sneakiest stocks in the market is Callaway Golf. Many of you have probably used one of their drivers before on the golf course. But even if you haven’t, people are enjoying this gains:9. Etsy ($ETSY) +6% in AprilEtsy made our list last month, and shows no signs of slowing down. One investor asks the question all bulls are asking: “What correction?” This chart shows it breaking out, and hitting its highest levels since its IPO:@jkapusnak8.Palo Alto Networks ($PANW) +6% in AprilPalo Alto Networks earned a spot on our rankings last month as it attacked all-time highs. While it didn’t move a ton in April, it crept closer to said ATHs. One trader broke down the technicals for this chart, believing a huge breakout is on its way. Let’s see if $PANW makes it to next month’s rankings…or fizzles at the ATHs.Note: one of our favorite technical analysts pitched the entire cybersecurity sector at our annual event in New York City.@theEquilibrium7. Bitcoin ($BTC.X) +36% in AprilCryptocurrencies dropped insanely hard after Bitcoin hit $20,000 in December. Volatility came down along with it. In December, $BTC.X saw a range peak of $4,700. Today, its daily range is now closer to $100. During the month of April, Bitcoin had a massive rally, and here’s how investors feel right now:@sam_smithh6. Google ($GOOGL) -1.5% in AprilOf all the FANG stocks, this one moved the least. In-fact, it was negative for the month and this is a first.We just added a stock that’s coming off a down month.That’s because it held up extremely well during the sell-off. Some traders think it is just a matter of time before it catches up to its brother/sister stocks. After all, Google is not slowing down in many capacities, including hiring real live humans. (Yes, humans.) Technical traders think we are holding on some really strong support too.@vishal5. Netflix ($NFLX) +5.5% in AprilNetflix did it again. Growing subscribers, growing revenue, and growing debt, as one user points out. This is every reaction you need to see from this month’s earnings report. Is the pace of debt growing too fast, or will the trend higher continue?@josen6264. Amazon ($AMZN ) +8.2% in AprilAmazon put the market on its shoulders in May. They rocked earnings, absolutely crushed EPS ($3.27 per share vs $1.26 estimates), and reported strong growth in advertising and cloud growth. Shares jumped over 7% on this news ,and sent the stock to new all-time highs. Check out this graph on how the big tech companies are making money these days.@trade_nut3. Facebook ($FB) +7.6% in AprilFacebook has gone through it all this year. But it all came down to Zuckerberg, when he appeared before Congress, and apologized for the recent data breach that occurred with Cambridge Analytica. (Here is a hilarious photo of how some saw the hearing.) Yet $FB bulls fear nothing, as earnings simply shrugged all that off. Revenue growth YoY has been the strongest for $FB, compared to its FANG counterparts.@CharlieBilello2. Chipotle ($CMG) +31% in AprilTwo images explain why Chipotle takes the number 2 spot this month. We’ll just leave these two charts here for you to awe at:Earnings metrics…@SeanDavid…and this beaut.@techniquant1. Lululemon ($LULU) +12% in AprilLululemon was the number one stock on the Power Rankings last month because it broke out of a huge Cup & Handle Pattern. As it turns out, you sometimes can’t keep a good chart down. LULU never looked back. A trader recently pointed out how it was breaking out of a massive six-year range. Even Howard Lindzon, the co-founder of StockTwits, is showing his support, rocking all LULU gear.@GregRieben
