Merculet ICO Review — Decentralized Attention Network? $500 Bitcoin giveaway http://thecryptosphere.co/giveaway ?Merculet is a Decentralized attention value network. Creators get paid for content that get attention. Think Instagram where you get paid if your video gets 1 million views. Cool shizz. It’s a Chinese ICO. Solid team who worked before on a similar non-blockchain company in the advertising and tech space (magicwindow.cn).Twitter: https://twitter.com/dvircrypto Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dvircrypto/ Telegram: http://t.me/thecryptosphereSummary: Good idea, unoriginal, Strong team, weak advisors, Focused on China, No prototype, Roadmap ok, Low hype, Token metrics: good for private sale, bad otherwise They’re raising at a high valuation for a strong bear market. Changed hardcap, private sale bonus, hard to measure because it’s a Chinese ICO.
