The principle of operation, I believe, you are well known. A person places his resume with us, after which the interested persons come out with him.According to the insider information, only ten percent of registered users in the system from the first time were able to get a job. What does it say? The system is far from perfect. The employer rarely specifies all the requirements for potential employees, and the applicant is very often exaggerate their strengths and hide weaknesses.That is why, as it seems to me, there must be a system capable of providing a higher percentage of successful meetings.Such a platform in the future may become a project of the company TeachMePlease, which is called Disciplina.io.What is it like?1. This is its own block-architecture with open source. Thus, anyone can create an application to work with it. It can be like any big company, and a small group of tutors, who decided to connect to the system.2. This system is able to provide a high level of trust between all users registered in the system, since the information entered once into the system is unchanged.3. The interaction between registered users is in the mode of microtransactions in its own crypto currency.The last point is particularly interesting in view of the fact that educational institutions will be given the opportunity to monetize their archive of data on the progress of students. What does it mean? If the employer wants to accept the work of really worthy and intelligent employees, he will need to pay for this information. Thus, universities with the most able students will earn good money on this, and employers receive exceptionally gifted workers. Those who do not care about the quality of education will have to either change their approach or leave the market.Possibly in a sense, this will entail the collapse of the established system of education. However, in the end we will get an honest and competitive system, grounded for maximum labor efficiency. As a result, every person or organization participating in this project will become richer. Therefore, we can count on an almost infinite growth.Also Disciplina.io offers a truly unique function, which all school leavers probably dream of. I’m talking about the fact that the system itself is able to build an optimal and concrete path of instruction for achieving specific goals. Is not this a miracle? There is a possibility to really influence your future. It is enough just to click a mouse a couple of times and pay for the corresponding service in local currency.Well, and most importantly, all confidential information: personal data, certificates, assessments, previous jobs and others — are in private. And the participant of the system can manage the boundaries of privacy. This is done to preserve the personal data of users, as well as to store materials that are objects of copyright or commercial secret.Disciplina.io uses its own blockchain.Thus, Disciplina.io is one of the most promising and necessary projects for this world.WhitePaper (ENG): https://disciplina.io/WhitePaper_eng.pdfTeam:Bounty Program: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3101698.0Click on the links below to read more information about the project:Onepager: https://disciplina.io/pres-eng.pdfTechnicalPaper: https://disciplina.io/yellowpaper.pdfFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/tchmpls.events/Twitter: https://twitter.com/tchmpls_eventsTelegram: https://t.me/tchmplsInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tchmpls.events/Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdRWnzR6WWEiaQlVqGHwOpgMedium: https://medium. com/ tchmpls_eventsANN: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2325715Guthub: https://github.com/serokell/disciplinaAdditional Contacts:Worldwide:+3728803644E-Mail: offers@disciplina.io
