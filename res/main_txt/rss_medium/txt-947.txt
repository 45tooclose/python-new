How to Avoid Being a Victim of Whipsaw Patterns!We don’t use this word too much in the wacky world of cryptocurrency, but it’s something that we ALL need to be aware of, because MANY of the coins that we trade (Bitcoin included) constantly go into consolidation/whipsaw patterns.(Disclaimer: Nothing in or about this article is financial advice. Just research based on already existing information + my opinion)But, before we get into that — let’s address this thing head on first.What is a Whipsaw Pattern?In my experience, this definitely happens most frequently with low-cap coins. This could be due to simple fluctuations in the market or just pure, unadulterated manipulation (I’m not here to judge). But, if you’re confused on which, check out this article that I wrote here on how to detect pump and dumps in the market.Here’s an Example of Whipsaw Patterns Occurring in Crypto:I used the price movement for $ARDR/BTC as an exampleAs you can see above, I drew light-golden circles to show you all the times that the price direction of $ARDR/$BTC changed abruptly.This isn’t mean to pick on $ARDR because this happens with a lot of cryptocurrencies in the space! However, it’s something that confuses a lot of traders and results in loss — frequently.Why?Here’s What Happens to a LOT of Traders in Crypto (especially newcomers):I think this has happened to just about every crypto trader in mankind at LEAST once.This is the most common scenario for beginning traders that are making their first foray into cryptocurrency.A lot of folks see the the huge profits that certain coins make per day and think to themselves, “How easy would it be for me to catch some of those gains?”They try to take on the deceptively difficult task of daytrading in crypto and end up leaving with lighter pockets like our unfortunate pal, Joe Blow has in the example above.How Did This Happen to Joe Blow?Because he was being whipsawed and he didn’t even know it.As the picture above states, if Joe had simply held his entry and remained firm through the whipsaws, he could’ve potentially walked away with profits of as much as 20%+.How Would Joe Have Known Where to Exit or Set Stop Losses?Great question. That’s what the many other articles I’ve posted on Technical Analysis (on this Medium) and in the Telegram (t.me/CoinEducation) come in.Also, my article on locking in profits in is another key guide (not financial advice) that may help traders to ensure that they can retain most of their profits without having to be Nostradamus.How to Take Profits SuccessfullyInterested in access more free crypto analysis, resources and information like this? Check out these platforms:medium.comWhat I PrescribeThis is why I generally believe that people should be fairly liberal with their stop losses if they are setting some, because whipsaws can cost you a LOAD of profit and may even result in some serious losses.This is also why I believe that day trading in crypto is difficult, if not impossible. It’s also unnecessary.Cryptocurrency isn’t like stock. Having a +20% delta portfolio with only stocks from the S&P500 index would be considered an amazing portfolio (although, maybe not so much in the recent bull run that U.S. markets have experienced). If you put up those types of numbers, you’d have hedge funds banging down your door.For cryptocurrency, it’s more than plausible that one could increase their portfolio by 300% or more with intelligent trading strategies and techniques.However, it’s also possible that one may face massive losses. And many times, those losses come from being the victim of whipsaw patterns.Indicators to Use During Whipsaw PatternsSource: https://www.investopedia.com/university/indicator_oscillator/ind_osc1.aspWhy?Because Lagging Indicators will give you SUPER LATE entry/exit points and cost you a lot of profits in whipsaw patterns.Lagging Indicators are best used when there is a clear and defined trend and you would like to confirm said trend.Source: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laggingindicator.aspHere’s Are Some Infographics That Make This a Bit More DigestibleSo, How Do I Know What to Use For Whipsaw?In my opinion, the best indicators for whipsaws will be leading ones because the lagging indicators will be almost entirely ineffective at detailing what the market has been doing.ConclusionHopefully, this guide has at least helped some people out there that have been struggling with trading in the cryptocurrency markets as of recent.Whether we’re in a “bull” or “bear” market, this is important information to know if you don’t want to incur substantial losses.If you want to receive more information like this in live-time, please check out:Twitter = twitter.com/CryptoMedicatedTelegram = t.me/CoinEducationThanks!
