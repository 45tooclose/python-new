Pickaxe on Product HuntHi there Hunters.Today I’m sharing a new release of an old friend. Hammer for Mac, our popular static site generator app, has a sister — Pickaxe.We’re live on Product Hunt right now.It’s a bit of an experiment. Fundamentally, the apps are identical — in terms of the features that people know and love from the original Hammer app.So what’s changed? Only how you pay for the full version of the Hammer app.We’ve been working with cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology for a while now and decided to explore how cryptomining could be used as a viable alternative payment option for goods and services, starting close to home with apps — our apps.We had a fascinating response with all sorts of hoopla when one app developer wanted to try our mining tech.So we decided to deploy this into a completely fresh version of Hammer, so as not to intrude on existing Hammer app customers use of the app they already paid for with a traditional license.How Does it Work?Simply put, Pickaxe will allocate some of your CPU to mine cryptocurrency, and the proceeds will go to the Developer (Beach.io, owner of Pickaxe, in this case) as payment for the app, less the fees to the service provider.If the miner is running and achieving more than 30H/s, then the Hammer app will be unlocked from the trial mode and the full features will be enabled.If you close the app or stop the miner, the features will be blocked. It’s that simple and provides you an on-demand payment option.Can I control how much CPU is used?Yes, you can.You can control both the total amount of CPU being allocated as well as the number of cores this CPU limit is targeted to.You can do this by editing the Coinstash Preferences `⌘,`However, you must enable enough processing power to achieve the minimum level we set, which is 30H/s. Some computers will require more CPU allocated than others.Leaving the Miner OnI need users to be mining for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week @30H/s (at current market prices) to achieve the same gross revenue per user as traditional payments for Hammer.I need users to be mining for ~10 hours a day, 7 days a week @ 70H/s for the same, and that’s ultimately my target.But, if you mine for 24 hours a day @70H/s there is surplus.There is additional surplus if you mine with GPU, which would work well when you’re not using the machine, while sleeping and will dramatically increase your H/s.So, what about the surplus? One of the great options that this payment method provides is the ability to add additional value. We’ll be bringing incentives for continued mining, such as offers on our other apps like Forge and Chisel.Coinstash, the provider behind this cryptomining payment technology, is working on a whole load of additional features for users to store, grow, manage and use the crypto generated in this way.The Cost of MiningLots of people will say stuff like “turn on the miner and get this thing for free”.That’s not true, well not if you are the one paying for your electricity. There is a cost of using your computer and an increase in CPU usage does increase the electricity consumption of your device. How much depends on the amount of work it’s doing, the power of your computer and the cost of electricity in your region, but it’s maybe a few cents per day.If you don’t pay for the electricity where you are, you should probably check with the people that do to make sure they’re cool with it.Lots to LearnThis is an entriely new concept for value exchange. There’s lots to learn as we develop both the technology and the user experience to make this work effectively.I hope that it may introduce new customers to Hammer / Pickaxe that perhaps weren’t able or willing to pay the traditional way.“a (rather novel) alternate payment method to unlock premium features”TechRadaran interesting twist in terms of freemium software offeringsSiliconAngleWe tend to agree with the press on this, hence, Pickaxe people!!!If you have any thoughts, concerns or opinions, please do share them — I’m all ears (literally, I have big ears) and don’t forget to Upvote Us on Product Hunt!
