Hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers with previously limited or no credit histories are getting credit profiles based on their digital data, and many that had very limited access to credit now have a variety of credit options right on their smartphones.While the online peer-to-peer lending that emerged a decade ago allowed many Chinese consumers to take out unsecured personal loans, the instant lending offerings introduced through mobile apps and at retail touchpoints in recent years are making a fundamental impact in China’s consumer credit market.Almost all of the top 20 Chinese tech companies now offer consumer credit through their mobile apps and websites. Platform businesses that connect merchants with consumers — including digital payment services, online retail marketplaces, service booking platforms, and even food ordering and delivery apps — are offering options to finance purchases instantly. Other online services are even providing short-term cash loans to their users directly, as well as a wave of independent mobile lending apps and online retail installment sales platforms.Leveraging their huge user and merchant bases, data, and development capabilities, the major tech companies developed their own end-to-end systems and are now significant players in consumer lending. Independent solution providers are also growing fast as they can easily expand their merchant client base online and offline, and scale up quickly at relatively low costs. (move to the third section?)These credit offerings are mainly targeted at young consumers who are mobile-savvy and likely have an insufficient credit history to get credit from conventional financial institutions, while a few lenders are focused on lower-income demographics who have historically had a hard time obtaining credit.The phenomenal growth of these online and mobile credit offerings is even attracting traditional retailers and conventional financial institutions. Many have developed similar systems or offerings, or established joint ventures or other forms of partnerships with tech companies.Driven by the rapid increase in available credit options, online consumer credit volume as a percentage of the overall consumer loan market in China increased from 0.5% in 2014 to 5.5% in 2016, and is expected to reach 9% in 2020 according to a report by the China International Capital Corporation (CICC). The outstanding balance of online consumer credit is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 37% in the next three years.Capturing New DataUnlike the United States, there is neither widely used credit score like FICO Score nor nationwide non-governmental consumer reporting agencies in China. It wasn’t until 2015 that the financial regulators began to allow private companies to enter the consumer credit reporting business. Previously the only national credit information database, operated by China’s central bank, serves mainly banking institutions. By the end of 2014 the central bank had credit records of 350 million people, less than one-third of China’s population.In 2014, the average number of credit cards per person in China was 0.34. That only increased to 0.36 in the third quarter of 2017, according to China’s central bank. General-purpose credit cards had been one of the few options for unsecured consumer credit before the emergence of online lending. Private label credit cards or point-of-sales lending barely existed. The personal loan market was small and dominated by state-owned or backed banking institutions.When Chinese tech companies rushed to the consumer credit market, a big data-based credit assessment and automated loan underwriting approach seemed a no-brainer given the new abundance of user data and had already been employing algorithmic decision-making for their existing internet services.The companies also take advantage of supplementary data sources for their automated credit assessments. Given the wide adoption of some tech services such as mobile payments and e-commerce in China, data points such as payment and money transfer histories, online and offline purchases, and online credit card repayments are considered to have high predictive values for credit decisioning.It’s not surprising then to see major e-commerce companies, like Alibaba and JD, and digital payment service providers — including Ant Financial, Tencent, and Legend Holdings’ fintech arm — are leading data-based automated credit decisioning within their services for consumers.And these internet platforms each cover hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers. For example, JD’s credit risk assessment system has already scored more than 300 million shoppers.However some companies are also experimenting with more controversial data. For instance, tech giants Tencent and Baidu claim that their credit decisioning systems have also factored in social data and search data, respectively.Now almost all consumer credit scorers in China claim they’ve adopted alternative data. The state issued the Regulation on Credit Reporting Industry in 2013, requiring consent before gathering user data or sharing data with any third party. But breaches and misuse of personal data at online lending sites are as common as in other internet service sectors in China and in the rest of the world, leading to growing concerns over personal information security.Despite this, big data-based technologies are still generally perceived as positive forces in China. The guidelines for the promotion of consumer finance innovations issued by financial regulators in 2016 even encouraged the development of big data-based online consumer loan products. The wide adoption of services like mobile payments and online money transfers has shown that Chinese consumers are willing to embrace technology-powered financial services. Generally, convenience wins over privacy and security.Boosting Consumer Credit GrowthNew credit options offered by tech companies have gained massive tractions as the experience provided through these mobile apps easily beat traditional credit card issuers or other personal loan lenders. Tech companies essentially added credit options onto their mobile apps and websites like new, free features.Because credit limits and interest rates are automatically determined based on the existing data, the user considered creditworthy only needs to activate these options with a few clicks.And given the rapid consumer adoption, millions of existing merchants have little choice but to accept the new credit options of the e-commerce and digital payment platforms. Many of them, including the fintech arms of Alibaba and JD, have opened their credit assessment and underwriting systems to third parties. It didn’t take long for the independent lenders, especially those that have no access to the central banks’ credit information database and depended on conventional offline sales channels for borrower acquisition and risk assessment, to realize not only is it much easier to reach potential borrowers on these big internet platforms, but also that the costs for acquiring relatively creditworthy borrowers could be a fraction of the costs through their previous channels. Independent loan underwriting platforms have signed up a variety of online and mobile services, physical retailers, and brands to provide credit lines or point-of-sales financing.Ant Credit Pay, the virtual revolving line of credit available to users of Alipay (Alibaba’s digital payments affiliate), boasts 100 million users, or about 20% of the total users of the Alipay payment service. 86% of its users of were born between 1980 and 1999 as of November 2017.Tencent offers a cash credit line and auto loan product through WeChat and Mobile QQ, the most popular messaging apps in China. Weilidai, the cash revolving loan product, helped 15 million borrowers as of the end of 2016 according to WeBank, the online-banking affiliate of Tencent.Major lenders and solution providers claim their credit performance is strong and many, such as the two products provided by the Alibaba’s finance arm, report significant profits.These new fintech products in China are already having a strong influence on economic development throughout the country. And how they evolve in the near future can certainly help to inspire a similar wave of applications in nations around the world.The Comet Labs Research Team in Beijing explores industry and AI technology trends in China, and seeks to understand how they might serve as helpful cases for startups in the United States and around the world.
