FOMO Leading Words You Need to Pay Attention in the DiscordOften you would have seen the messengers whispering these subliminal messages in their discord chats — covertly.Huh..smart, but not smart enough.Look what I have found, using non-Artificial Intelligence method..huh. I spotted these leading words to solicit people to buy what they hinted.What I did is simply joining the chat and scanning the conversation word by word — so, much more advanced than AI right?Watch out this type of sentences:“So, Did we miss out TRX” — - the guy just asked you to jump and not to be late.“Huge Sell off yesterday on OMG” — again he’s hinting for you to buy.“SNGLS just hit another new low” — - really, he’s asking you to join.Basic principles in trading:“BUY LOW, SELL HIGH”No matter what the promoters said, if you don’t see the Zone to Buy, why do you bother?One more thing to take a note:“IF for whatever reason, another person has got lucky with his trade, you don’t need to get itchy. And never feel that the wagon just left you and never come again”Control your emotion, do not get carried away.. and never get mis-led by other traders (messengers) claiming that they have won the trade by 20–30% or whatever “good to be true” statement covertly or overtly.Lesson learnedOther’s success can not be used as your benchmark to win in a trade.Because their trade style and yours could be different, and maybe totally opposite.Analyze your own Past trades, and run through with someone you trust. You will learn from the mistakes that you have done, at the same time you will know which trade style has high probability of winning.“You can share with me to help you analyze your past trades, “free of charge” — I dont intend to make business out of this, so don’t worry :).Post it in the comments, we’ll go through it together.If you are getting rich with this approach, I will be more than happy.. because at least I have liberated a human being from the poverty.Enjoy your trade, and make believe… You have the best Trade Style ever!
