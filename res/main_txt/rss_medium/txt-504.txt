Plagues, famine, rising sea levels and extreme weather are some of the symptoms. Human extinction is a real possibility. There should be a non partisan war against Climate Change and its effects but unfortunately some have drawn a line in the sand and have condemned the facts for their own self interests and gains. It is up to us to fight back in whatever way we can. This is what inspired 3 guys from northwest Ohio to combine their passion for #ClimateAction and expertise in different fields to create a revolutionary process to make the world a little greener for our children and generations to come.By harnessing the power of cryptocurrency the BuildGreen team has begun a quest to change the world one byte at a time. BuildGreen Coin targets the construction sector and rewards sustainable efforts. By utilizing LEED ( an existing government endorsed grading system) we can easily and effectively airdrop participants rewards after projects are completed.BuildGreen Coin offers instant incentives to projects that complete sustainable construction.BuildGreen is cultivating a working ecosystem between the trillion dollar construction sector and the self sustaining cryptocurrency market.Most importantly BuildGreen Coin is directly impacting the climate. We estimate that each coin will divert 1,608 pounds of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, 116 pounds of construction waste from landfills, and 1,210 gallons of waste water from treatment plants.The future matters to the BuildGreen team.
