Daneel Bounty and Airdrop tokens distribution updateMany of you are eagerly waiting for the updated status of daneel bounty program and airdrop tokens! We certainly have never forgot you. The process to gather all information took a long time. And apologies for the delay in distribution. We ran into few obstacles in the way. But now, we are all set!IMPORTANT NOTICE:Tokens from the 2 bounty programs will be distributedThe first program lasted 5 weeks, the second 14 weeksAbout 3.4M tokens has been spent to the bounty programs and for the airdrop, see the breakdown of allocation right below:The total number of FREE TOKENS is around 3388948 DAN (This might vary a little) and percentage wise 4.7% from total supply. That makes around 12% from circulating supply.The average predicted dump per day will be around = 3,388948M/20 = 169447,4 DAN (Worst case Scenario) which won’t create a small ripple in the market. However we must be ready for potential dumping in portions. We have to take into account different points:Translation people got large quantities in terms of DAN tokens. There is a risk involved in that. IF someone dumps let’s say 30k-40k tokens, it will be emphasized by the community which will result a snowball effect.Bounty tokens can influence the market in a negative way. It will create FUD, unwarranted news, gossips.Hence, we decided to create a distribution plan. We dearly think community will provide us the full support. We can’t disclose the plan to public but we had a brainstorm session with all the core members about it. And came up with the perfect plan. We hope every bounty member comprehend the value of DAN token in the future. Small percentage of bounty hunters will flip it for a quick buck but majority of them will be willing to keep it and hold it tight till the product is launched.Furthermore, we kept some good news to distill throughout the distribution to maintain confidence:we will publish a very cool video of the product with a new special feature with Google Homewe will announce a new partnership with a trading exchangewe will launch a PR campaign with the video to spread the good news about DaneelWe should receive some feedback from exchanges, unfortunately, we cannot disclose anything until it is official, because we have signed non-disclosure agreements/NDA.Finally, we count on you, our community, to banish the negativity and attract new followers with shares, comments, likes on all your networks.Stay tuned and spread the positive vibe about DaneelCheers~Daneel TeamTwitter: https://twitter.com/daneelprojectTelegram: t.me/DaneelCommunityFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/daneelprojectLinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/11348931/Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Daneel_Project/
