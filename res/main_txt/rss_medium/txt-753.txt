Stewie Zhu on DCC’s plans for the Southeast Asian marketIn the interview with VITV, a leading TV network in Vietnam, Stewie Zhu, founder and CEO of DCC, commented on the blockchain industry in Southeast Asia, and explained DCC’s plans for this region.Blockchain in Southeast AsiaThe blockchain market is rapidly expanding in Southeast Asia, which I believe is going to be the next hub of innovation and international collaboration. With all sorts of blockchain applications appearing from startups in the part of the world and the strong industry that the area possesses, Southeast Asia is proving to be the go-to spot for blockchain development.The prosperity of the blockchain industry here is mainly because of strong government support for Fintech innovators and investors, especially in countries like Singapore. Also there are a lot of blockchain technology-related enthusiasm in Thailand. For example, Thailand Post, the country’s state-owned postal service, announced it would begin using blockchain technology to track high-value parcel deliveries, for expensive and luxury.In the financial sector, one of the country’s biggest commercial banks has recently launched a “completely paperless” Letter of Guarantee network in conjunction with IBM Blockchain.The Philippine government believes that some 17 percent of the country has limited or no access to electricity and some believe that blockchain can provide a solution.As for Vietnam, it’s clear that interest in blockchain technologies is growing rapidly here and Vietnam is one of the most dynamic tech hubs in the world. I believe this is just the start for Vietnam to identify and realize blockchain potentials, and it has huge opportunities to leverage its robust tech talents and tech-savvy communities to bootstrap numerous startup projects。DCC’s Roadmap in Southeast AsiaSoutheast Asia is a critical market for us and we couldn’t emphasize more to expand our footprint here.As you know, the online consumer finance industry in Southeast Asia has been growth exponentially. Venture capital has been streaming into marketplace lending platforms based here, driven by limited regulation fostering innovation and consumer need for alternative lending products.
