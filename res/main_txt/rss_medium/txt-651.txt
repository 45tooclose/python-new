THE BEST WAY OF STORING YOUR GENOMESince the beginning of the evolution of man, man has come to face many defects in the form of variation which includes, face shape colour,behaviors, speech and others including muscle mass. This we know plays from external factors such as environment, nutrition and care but we all know that this factors are only enhancers of what we are actually made up of which simple is our DNA which is concealed in the Nucleus of our individual cells and make us who we are and what we do. In other to understand how human evolved, the active part of human DNA and how humans are related to other living creatures in the world the world decided to undergo a project which entails the sequencing of the whole human genome. The next question you might ask is what is this human genome, genome is the complete genetic makeup of an organism. You may be asking yourself what does this have to do with me the answer is simple, during the period of evolution for man the nuclear material in human underwent many changes which made many protein product from this nuclear material in a way that some caused defect to the normal man function. Many at this this traits can be inherited from inherited from mother to daughter cell and worst of it such undesired changes also called mutation can be transferred through sex cells which are the sperm or ova and when such are united to form a child the child inherits this traits and might be fully expressed in the child even if the parent aren’t expressing such traits this as lead to various rare genetic disease which can be traced from either the father or the mother and most times the parents are usually carriers of such defect.most of this defects are usually due to defect or deficiency in a particular protein or exams in the body.Since the success in the sequencing of human genome, many companies are now involved in this projects but at a very high price so it makes it difficult for people to complete know their genetic makeup and save their upcoming offspring from suffering from genetic defect.A platform called SHIVOM PLATFORM has decided to use the BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY due to its transparency and effectiveness to provide the affordable services of storing individuals genome and if required by owners can get their genome sequenced and by order of the owner of the genome decide to sell this genetic to get some financial benefits. To operate this platform, shivom has produced a token which will be used to operate shivom ecosystem.
