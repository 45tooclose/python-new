Thanks for taking the time responding to my blog post. I have seen a couple answers like this and I will address them and rewrite some of the now outdated parts in a new piece on Eos. I will let you know when it’s coming out. I’m currently still working on an article on shitcoins but after that I will start working on the Eos one.
