What is AirDrop?Airdrops are the crypto analogous to free samples in the supermarket. Projects that are just starting out will oftentimes sling out small amounts of free tokens to verified people in order to spread the good word about their project.Tokens can be used to popularize a completely new coin, which doesn’t exist yet in the exchanges, and only a preliminary sale of tokens is carried out.In addition, token developers can distribute free coins to existing holders of a cryptocurrency in a certain proportion (for example, depositing 10% of the volume of coins currently in the wallet).This allows you to make a token popular in a short time and attract more investors. Of course, the distribution of tokens is limited.To participate in AirDrop is really quite simple, you need to perform a couple of simple actions: for example, to enter the telegram channel, fill in your login in the google form, specify the Ethereum wallet and get your coins / tokens in a short time. The service TokenBoom.io decided to undermine this industry. To get AirDrop on it, there is no need to take any actions, it’s enough to keep more than 1 ETH on your Ether wallet. In general, on the tokens in the email you will receive detailed information about the project and its upcoming ICO.This is much easier than bounty campaigns, which require more complex actions, for example, bug search, design creation, whitepaper translation into other languages, posts on a personal forum, advertisements on thematic forums and comments. For that you need to either have certain skills, or popular accounts (most often in a bounty conditions indicated the minimum number of subscribers) and of course you need to have free time.TokenBoom.io also allows you to profit by simply learning about an interesting project — you can sell the received tokens immediately after they are released for the exchange and exchange them for bitcoin, or let them sit for a long time.Visit TokenBoom.io and get free tokens from top ICO projects.Follow us on Twitter!Like us on Facebook!Join our Telegram!
