Zebi comes from zebibyte (102⁴⁷) to signify the capability to protect and process large sets of data. They considered various technologies in 2015 for immutability, including write once read many (WORM) type of machines, but the options are expensive and not suitable for Big Data. They stumbled on Blockchain in late 2015. Most of 2016 was spent on building a globally innovative Zebi Private Blockchain with flexible integration of Ethereum Public Blockchain, to protect high value and sensitive data like land registry, education documents, health records etc. One patent is filed, two in progress.For rest of 2018, the team are on the way to expand data protection to education and employment records, and also provide Data As A Service (DaaS) APIs for instant data exchange, while governing use of data through transparent smart contracts. This brings a significantly higher level of trust among the three ecosystem players: Data Providers, Data Requestors and Individuals whose data is being protected and used for legitimate purposes.For 2019, the R&D of public blockchain would solidify into a concrete system that solves broad array of real world problems with significantly improved features compared to current public blockchains. This removes our current dependency on Ethereum. It also allows Decentralized Apps to be built on Zebi Public Blockchain with broad use cases ranging from Credit Scoring and Background Verification.2020 would involve building more complex smart contracts and trustable business insights on Zebi Public blockchain, as we expect blockchains in general move beyond financial industry and to more and more industries.For more information, see https://www.zebi.io/Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/ZebidataIndia/Twitter : https://twitter.com/ZebidataIndiaLinkedIn : https://www.linkedin.com/company/zebi/Reddit : https://www.reddit.com/user/ZebiData/Steemit/Blog : https://medium.com/@ZebidataTelegram : https://t.me/ZebiDataLink to White Paper : https://www.zebi.io/assets/wp.pdf
