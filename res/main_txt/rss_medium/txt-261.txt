Week of 4/9/18It’s been a crazy week out here, hence the delay. Maybe weekly posts would be too often; will consider making them bi-weekly.Node modules: a streak of dominoshttps://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/A team partner and I were discussing node and how projects end up becoming heavily convoluted as dependencies rely on other dependencies. The good of this plug-and-play characteristic is that developing is convenient. The downside is that if one crucial dependency goes down, it can trigger a domino effect in terms of numerous dependencies then failing.Decentralized marketplaceshttps://www.openbazaar.org/blog/how-moderators-and-dispute-resolution-work-in-openbazaar/The decentralized market problem is a tough one to solve, in part due to settlement of disputes. When there’s no centralized party to determine who’s wrong in a case, that void needs to be filled, as only in a utopian environment would sellers and buyers always be completely happy. To be fair, percentage-wise, not many transactions are disputed. In fact, only 0.037% of Visa’s transactions were disputed in the year 2013 (h/t NYT), but that amounted to $765.9 million, a sizable amount.Getting back on track, you can think about Open Bazaar, very roughly, as a decentralized version of eBay in that transactions are made on a peer-to-peer basis. If you read the article, start where it says 2 of 3 multisig. Pretty much, 2 out of 3 parties must be in agreement for a certain result to happen. It’s quite simple; it just comes down to that third party (the moderator) being honest. There’s a subreddit just to find trustworthy moderators. I find it interesting that community is a constant in terms of importance, when it comes to the development of any decentralized project.Swarm vs. IPFShttps://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/2138/what-is-the-difference-between-swarm-and-ipfsFirst of all, you should always take stackexchange/stackoverflow posts with a grain of salt. However, most would agree that there is a bunch of very smart people on it, and as a resultSwarm and IPFS, in short, are both decentralized file transfer systems. Have not yet read enough into each of them to develop an opinion as to which might be better, so I’ll have to earmark this one for another day.Truffle boxhttps://truffle-box.github.ioLooking to develop on top of Ethereum? Truffle, a ConsenSys spoke, is developing a suite of tools to help devs build full-stack dApps as well as smart contracts. In short, Truffle’s resources are a must-check-out.Penn Blockchain Conference Summaryhttp://www.thedp.com/article/2018/04/blockchain-conference-wharton-upenn-currency-penn-philadelphiahttps://www.coindesk.com/dear-students-everything-bitcoins-way-1-billion-opportunity/Over the past weekend, Penn Blockchain held its very first conference. We had numerous high-profile speakers, including Emin Gün Sirer, Ari Paul, Albert Wenger, Amber Baldet, Elizabeth Stark, and many more.The general sentiment was that regardless of current price trends, we’re still in the late 1st quarter of the game if we’re looking at blockchain adoption as a sports metaphor.There’s soooo much to be built in this space, and that’s what drives me to learn as much as I can so I can get out there and start iterating.Contribute to Lightninghttps://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/code_contribution_guidelines.md#ReqReadinghttps://dev.lightning.communityhttp://maxfa.ngAs mentioned in the previous bit, Elizabeth Stark was at Penn to talk about Lightning Labs. She was incredibly enthusiastic about the open-source nature of contributing to their mission, and I found that incredibly encouraging and motivating. If you’d like to start contributing to Lightning, take a look at these links, and get to work.Jack Mallers’ Zap Wallet is a project that I’ll definitely be keeping my eyes on. It’s written in Electron (JavaScript), a language that I’m pretty familiar with. Zap’s UI actually looks pretty and easy to use, two characteristics that’ll grow increasingly urgent as we try to get blockchain applications to become more mainstream.
