Dear Galaxy,If you’re reading this we’ve done it, all the work the Unicorn troopers fought for was not in vain.The mission we set out to accomplish was clear:Create a trustless system of self governing bodies, capable of uniting around causes they choose to support.Build a platform that fosters experimentation, collaboration and open source initiatives.Awaken the Giver within all the citizen of this Galaxy and beyond, by showing them how and where their contributions make a difference.The Centralization forces were determined to keep the Galaxy under their control, well we couldn’t let that happen, not for our sake and the sake of generations to come.To accomplish our mission we had to do something greater than simply unseating the unjust forces.We had to show them a better way!The way of the Unicorn.We started a battle that will never end, the fight for truth, justice and transparency between citizens and powers is one that must live on forever.It’s up to you to keep this fight alive all throughout your Galaxy, to inspire, incite and expose the truth for all to see.This was the cause we chose to fight for, the one we believed mattered most to our generation.Now it’s your turn to decide, what will you fight for?We’ve given you the tools, to sculpt your future, build your community and free yourselves.Use them wisely and never, EVER…… Forget!The way of the Unicorn ( ͡o ͜ʖ ͡o)~ Giveth
