Before and After BitcoinBefore Bitcoin, sequential electronic ownership of property on the internet didn’t exist. Bitcoin sparked the emergence of a new asset class designed in the image of limited resources, but existing as a highly transportable and divisible method of wealth transfer that circumvents the inefficiencies of middlemen or physical commodity stores of wealth. Low correlation with any other asset classes over its ten year history in combination with its anti inflationary mechanics, uniquely positions Bitcoin as an invaluable instrument for savvy investors looking for uncorrelated returns. Since it’s inception, Bitcoin has outperformed all other alternative investments while allowing portfolio managers to diversify the source of their returns.Exagon’s expertise is understanding Bitcoin and other alternative Blockchain technologies with sufficient tradable liquidity to provide a unique uncorrelated value proposition. In a world where increasingly interconnected financial markets make true statistical diversification more difficult, Bitcoin and Blockchain assets are emerging as the fastest growing asset class whose gains are not as correlated to traditional asset classes.Bitcoin and Blockchain are not just about money; that is just the most visible vector of disruption, and arguably its most potent, since money fuels the engine of human incentives.Beyond its promise to be the first open source, stateless money, Bitcoin is also broadly redesigning the information architecture that underlies our world in ways that empowers its participants. Bitcoin’s Blockchain has ushered in unrestricted/uncensored peer-to-peer exchange, secure identity, decentralized truth consensus, and record keeping validation, to name some of the leaps Bitcoin is responsible for.The idea is that if we can build a transparent network of monetary exchange without the corruption and third parties, we can do it with just about anything. This includes how we trade, how we think about the voting process, how to end wars, and how to create prosperity within society.
