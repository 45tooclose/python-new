Major banks earned more in metals than oil last yearDiamonds may be a girl’s best friend but gold is the ultimate cultural symbol of luxury.As the mining industry highly impacts the global economy, it was a no shocker when last year the world’s biggest investment banks earned more by trading and selling metals and minerals than with oil.1.6 billion of their revenues last year, came from the mining sector only. This year, as volatility and prices go up, metal-related revenues are expected to increase even higher.With many upcoming companies merging blockchain technology with gold mining, including Innovative-Minerals, a higher safety standard, is expected to improve as well. Blockchain technology platforms are sure to increase transactions, which may have an impact on the increase in the demand for gold.
