Kambria — The Blockchain Platform that is Revolutionizing the Robotics IndustryOverviewKambria is a decentralized platform for the exchange of robotic designs and code that will allow collaboration between developers in the robotics industry.Developers will receive incentives for the contributing robotics designs/code and for utilizing the platform.IndustryData in the robotics industry is currently bottlenecked by high-costs and a lack of coordination between developers. This environment is burdensome on startups requiring them to allocate time and high costs towards commonly encountered problems. Due to these limitations, robotics collaboration is behind the curve compared to its software counterpart and competition in the industry is stagnated.StrategyKambria will provide an environment were the continuation and advancement of new robotics development can thrive. To encourage participation, contributions to the platform will be rewarded with tokens, bounty rewards, and tips. The project even offers legal protection for those contributors wishing to have their content published. Kambria will create strict guidelines for new content that will make the interchanging of technology seamless with minimal overhead. Smart contracts will govern the transactions between different parties utilizing the platform.Kambria will accelerate adoption by contributing the entire codebase of their Ohmni robot. This will cover a lot of the fundamentals of robotics such as movement, speech, cameras, display, connectivity, batteries, motors, etc. In addition, some partners such as AEEON (Asus) and AutoDesk ($2billion revenue) will participate at launch to add more specialized robotics content. When successful, this should lead to an influx of market leading innovators to the Kambria platform.Use CasesKambria will be attractive to an audience that wants to save time and have low startup costs by not reinventing the wheel.As the platform progresses it will be able to be used as a marketplace for specialty code.Competition — Kambria & SingularityNETBoth are decentralized platforms backed by strong companies. SingularityNET is founded by Hanson Robotics and Kambria by Ohmni Labs.The two projects rely on community member contributions to be successful and both seek to revolutionize their specialized industriesDifferencesKambria focuses on robotics while SingularityNET focuses on AI.Robotics versus AIThe difference between Robotics and AI on a technical level is drastically different even though it might not seem so from a high level. The easiest and most oversimplified way to categorize the difference would be hardware versus software or even physical versus mental. Robotics focuses more on censors, movement, and spacial awareness. Robotics use case examples such as bomb defusal, factory line automation, welding, deep sea diving missions, and a plethora of other scenarios. AI focuses on machine learning, logical reasoning and scientific computing.Kambria can coexist with their AI competitors and not have to worry about competing for resources. The type of resources compiled on the Kambria platform will draw in a specific audience that most likely will be developing a product that doesn't deal with AI at all. Kambria hopes to be a go to resource for robotics resources.Team (9+ Members)Thuc Vu — Stanford (PhD) and Carnegie Mellon graduate.

They will be the one of the first robotics companies to break into the cryptocurrency scene and hopefully progress their industry. They have open-sourced their Ohmni robot which will play a critical role in helping kick-start their platform. Kambria has created unique partnerships with corporations to help drive quality adoption once the product goes live. If the past is an indication of the future, they will be successful like their previous startup.
