QuarkChain -A Super Scalable — Sharding BlockchainThe Question that boggles everyone’s mind — Will this Blockchain dethrone Ethereum ? Is this the next Top 3 CrytpoCurrency ? And that’s the main focus of this blog is to discuss about an upcoming ICO for a blockchain called QuarkChain.What is QuarkChain?QuarkChain is an permissionless blockchain architecture which aims to create a bifurcated or dual layer blockchain with main focus on scalability , security and decentralization.Quarkchain aims to be high-Capacity peer to peer transactional system with 1,000,000 TPS in coming futureTwo Layers/Protocols are:Sharding Layer- This layer facilitates higher scalability which breaks main blockchain into minor blockchains or Shards which processes a small portion of all the transactions independently and simultaneously. So scalablity is directly proportional to the number of Shards available . If number of shards increases so is the speed of transaction which in turn facilitates higher Scalability.Root Layer-Now on the security aspect we have root layer which confirms all the transactions in all the Shards using their block headers but does not directly process any transactions which also helps us with high speed transactionsPositives of QuarkchainQuarkchain will support the smart contract based on Ethereum Virtual Machines (EVM) which will allow all the DApps requiring high transaction speed and scalability can transfer on quarkchain.Strong team of proficient developers which made this project ahead of its own schedule by launching their TestNet way before time which builds confidence for the teamTestnet results3. The final positive which I see in this project is the low hardcap and lockup period which will avoid price dump by big whales and early adopters leading to a steady growth of the project.Few questions that are asked so many times on telegramWhat is early adopter phase and if it missed then are we eligible for KYC ?ANS- Early adopters are the people who joined telegram group on or before 5 May 2018 which gives them a little benefit during white-list process but anyone can still apply for KYC and can try for white-list2. When will KYC start and how much time do we have for that process ?ANS — KYC will start on 7 May 2018 and will take place for next 2 weeks after which a white-list will be prepared3. What is Min/Max investing cap for public sale?ANS- This will be decided after the KYC process.For all further information contact the team on telegram or wait for any official news on twitter.Token Metrics Total Hardcap: $20MTotal tokens: 10,000,000,000 tokensICO Token sale %: 20%ICO Token price: 1 ETH = 31533 QKC (Private sale bonus: 25%)Possible competitorsDragonchainzilliqaAChainFor more technical details the reader can visit Website-https://quarkchain.io/Whitepaper(English version) — https://quarkchain.io/QUARK%20CHAIN%20Public%20Version%200.3.2.pdf
