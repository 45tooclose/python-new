As always, we appreciate your thoughts and feedback as we work to improve and better serve you.Top line navigation improvementsThe first thing you’ll notice is that we’ve made some improvements to the top-line navigation. Additionally, you’ll notice a menu, which can be accessed on the far right to quickly navigate to your account area.The wallets area, removing clutterA common challenge for users can be to see their combined total asset value, balances for crypto assets in their exchange wallet and to navigate through long lists of crypto assets.As you now enter the QRYPTOS Wallet area, you will now be able to see a snapshot of your combined asset values at the top of the screen.Further, we’ve reduced the clutter in the list of crypto assets. Now, in order to take action on a crypto asset, simply hover and you can:● View transactions● Make deposits● Make withdrawalsSmoother workflows, easier search and more focusWe wanted to make the flows between navigating crypto assets and taking action on them smoother, easier to search and to bring more focus into critical tasks. This way, we hope to eliminate any possibility of user error, so it’s clear to users what task their doing and what crypto they’re focused on.QRYPTOS DepositsAdditionally, we’ve made it easier for you to add withdrawal addresses and securely withdraw funds from your exchange wallets.
