How to lower your transaction fees on Huobi Pro?At the first glance it seems Cryptocurrency Exchange trading fees from Huobi are slightly higher than its competitors.This is not necessarily the case, because there are ways to reduce your trading fees with a few tricks not many people know about yet. It involves using the Point Card, Huobi VIP and the Super Rebates program. If you utilize these loopholes correctly your transaction fees will be much lower than the fees you pay on other cryptocurrency exchanges. The examples below will make more sense if I explain the terms Huobi Point Card/ Super Rebates/ VIP first.What are Super Rebates?The Super Rebates program provides users that refer friends/ family members/ other interested parties 30 % in rewards from their transaction fees. You can use your referral link to introduce someone to Huobi. When they sign up using your link you will earn 30 % of the total transaction fees the signee has to pay to Huobi. An example: Someone signs up using your link and he/she makes trades for $ 10,000, the transaction fees will be 0.2% = $ 20. You than receive $ 6 (30 % of the total transaction fees). This will be valid for the first 3 months after the newly signed up user starts trading. You will find your personalized sign up referral link in your account details on Huobi Pro. Become a Huobi VIPHuobi VIP’s pay a monthly fee of Huobi Tokens to ensure an additional discount on trading fees. There are 5 categories that run from 10 % — 50 % off. For example for 30% off of your trading fees you need to pay 1200 HT per month. You will need to do your own calculations on whether this is profitable for you. If you are a swing trader it probably isn’t but if you are a day trader that trades with large amounts of money it probably is. To join look for the Become a VIP button in your account details on Huobi Pro.What is a Huobi Point Card?A Point Card is a prepaid card that holds an amount of points which you can use to get a reduction of your transaction fees when trading on Huobi Pro. With a Point Card you can also get a reduction from loan fees, margin fees and mining fees. 1 Point = 1 USDT fee.Only a limited amount of point packages are available each day.

Click on your account information next to the settings wheel in the top right corner on the website. In the drop down menu the second item from the top is My Point Card.Why do these point cards sell way below original price on the OTC (Over The Counter) market?When Huobi Token was first introduced, it was given away for free with the purchase of a point card. The Point Card costs 1 USDT per point, with each point buyers got one free Huobi Token. Huobi Token is trading for more than double almost triple the price of one Point Card Point, so basically the Point Cards bought were free as the Huobi Token is worth way more than the points. At the time of the Huobi Token release many people stocked up on Point Cards because of the incentive. For some it was more about acquiring cheap tokens than about buying Point Cards. This is the reason why Point Cards are being sold on forums and in unofficial Telegram channels for up to 75 % off. Point cards are easily transferrable between Huobi users. You can also use a Point Card in combination with Huobi VIP.   How to buy Point Cards OTC?There is an unofficial market where you can buy Point Cards. You can find them on Telegram.
