Proof Of Work Era Over?Why We Use Proof Of StakeIf you happened to wade through dozens of the ICO projects looking for the one to watch, you might have been baffled by the “Proof of …” diversity. There’s been a fair number of breakdown articles explaining the nuts and bolts of consensus algorithms, and we don’t strive to overrun them. The aim of this overview is to answer the frequent “How do I mine in your system?” and capture the latest trends in the universe of ICO supernovas.Proof of Work is the oldest and most commonplace. Implemented by Satoshi, this trustless consensus rewards the fastest in solving the cryptographic puzzle. It laid the foundation for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Dogecoin. The underbelly is that perplexing computational tasks call for powerful computing systems. In 2017, Bitcoin shook the world with 11-fold surge. And also with the formidable stats that of Bitcoin and Ethereum consuming more electricity than 159 world countries together. Talking of PoW, taking over 50% of the computing power is enough to hack the system. In Bitcoin it would be more than $5 billion, but most PoW systems are much smaller, like the ever emerging mining pools with the 100X ROI promises which can be found in abundance in Bitcointalk announcements.
