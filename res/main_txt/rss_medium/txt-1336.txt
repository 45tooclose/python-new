This creates endless backend hassle for accounting departments. mCart token eliminates this and allows retailers, malls and marketplace operators to pay influencers in crypto on Eretheum.Susan said what many in Silicon Valley think: we need to get back to developers as investors. The crowd cheered when she made this statement because it contributes to more innovation and viable products.
