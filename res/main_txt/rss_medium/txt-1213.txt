How does Bitcoin / Blockchain Mining work?From logistics to healthcare, from social media to real estate, from the energy sector to the global economy — Blockchain is predicted to transform almost every single industry in the next ten years. Often described as even more revolutionary than Artificial Intelligence, this technology is entering our lives at mind-blowing rates.While inspiring overall, this extreme pace also comes with a negative side: it means that education simply cannot keep up. The absence of quality training programs around blockchain means that many people will either miss out on opportunities in this new and exciting field, or even worse — will make premature career choices based on an erroneous understanding of what is possible and what isn’t.There are lots of concepts that allow Blockchain-powered projects and ideas to exist. It would take a whole online course to cover all of these topics (see end of this post for more details). That’s why today we are going to laser-in on just one concept. For this article I’ve picked perhaps the most used and, at the same time, most misunderstood topic: Mining.We’ve all heard about Bitcoin mining and miners. We’ve probably even used these terms. But what exactly do these miners do? What is mining all about? Those are the question we will be answering today and we will do this in three parts:Part 1: What’s a cryptographic hash?Part 2: The cryptographic puzzlePart 3: Block configurationNote: We’re going to look at the example of Bitcoin. Other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum may use different ideas (e.g. a different type of hash function) and therefore the specifics will vary, however the underlying concepts remain the same.
