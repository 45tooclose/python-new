Matt leads great NEO dApp workshop at Women In Blockchain HackathonOur very own Matt Moravec led a NEO dApp workshop last Saturday, April 14, at the Thor-sponsored Women In Blockchain Hackathon, hosted by Team Block Society. The event aimed to educate and encourage exposure for female developers interested in breaking into the often male-dominated blockchain space.Matt’s workshop was engaging and intimate, with around 20 participants — roughly half of which were women. The session was focused on teaching the developers to spin up a basic NEO dApp using Python. Around 80% of participants had some experience coding in Python, highlighting one of the many advantages of working on NEO.There were a few educational road bumps, mostly centered around the fact that the neo-python toolkit is accessed through the unix Terminal, which can be challenging for developers new to NEO. Matt was able to shepherd the inexperienced developers along, and by the end of the session, a few of the developers were prepared to write a basic NEO dApp!The Hackathon was a great way to connect with the community, and we were really happy to have the chance to participate!
