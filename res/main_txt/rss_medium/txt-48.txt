A crypto-trader’s diary — week 3Here’s week 1 and week 2 if you’re interested in the journey so far.If you’re on a bad or expensive internet connection and don’t want to download 800 pictures as you read an article, then you should run, run for the hills!Also, before I go on, a disclaimer. If you’re wondering if you should make decisions based on anything I have to say, I would suggest locating and spending some time with a three week old baby. After some quality time with the the bub, ask yourself if you consider them a good source of life advice.
