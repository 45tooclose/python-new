After further study I think Holo is on the right track (I like the graphics anyway). I am still confused though because I read that many, many people will get and house their Holo devices but don’t see how this will save energy. What are the costs to make all this new technology (both physical and monetary). What are the life spans of this technology and where will new replacements come from? Also, if you still need to hook up to “the internet” then, you are still supporting and continuing the base internet technology and energy consumption that underpins the worldwide web. I know these are tough questions and opinions, but I still haven’t heard any discussion about these deeper issues and it truly concerns me especially if we’re talking about supporting life/live systems.
