Community update #3We are approching the finish line fast, and a lot is going on these days in the MoneyRebel team!In March we had our beta testing bounty, and up until now we have already distibuted 150.000 MRP tokens for beta testers and over 50,000 MRP tokens for the ambassadors. Together we can accomplish amazing things.While you are helping us spread the word about the MR project among your community, we are doing our best at the conferences as well. So we went to Moscow, to a blockchain conference as well as to a crypto event which was actually organised solely for the MoneyRebel project. We also went to Zagreb as speakers at the conference »Blockchain — The Technology of the Future«. In addition to that, we were invited to Paris, where a crypto skilled advisororganised an event just for his followers and the MoneyRebel project.What comes next? Have a look at the video and Nataša Kozlevčar, our co-founder, will give you a walkthrough!_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ More on our story: www.moneyrebel.ioTelegram: https://t.me/moneyrebelFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/moneyrebel/LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/moneyrebelTwitter: https://twitter.com/moneyrebelteamReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/moneyrebel/
