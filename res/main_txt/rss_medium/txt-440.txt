If you are constantly lazy and refuse new and fashionable trends, do not attach any importance to them, then very soon you will be at the dump of history and go to work in McDonald’s or, worse, in a network marketing business.In order that this does not happen, you need to constantly develop and learn something new. It would seem that these are truisms. But we know how often people forget about them. As a result, they sit for years doing the same job as ten years before, without studying or even trying to learn anything new.Obviously, this happens for several reasons. It might be laziness, lack of time or just a fear of online education. Surprisingly, two of the three previously identified problems are solved just like them.1. You do not need to go anywhere.2. The lecture can be reviewed several times.3. If you do not like the course, you can always stop attending it, and Mom and Dad will not blame on you.4. Online education is extremely flexible. Unlike universities, “new knowledge” quickly reaches potential listeners.5. And, finally, your “new knowledge” will necessarily be in demand in the market.Online education really changes the world. Still some ten or fifteen years ago retraining of experts included huge financial expenses for visiting any evening or nonresident courses. In addition, the employee, as a rule, for some time dropped out of the work process.Now everything is much easier. A person can learn and combine work at the same time, as he can do it all the time. I agree that this is an endless race, but since we all participate in it, you can try to come firstMoreover, now there is such an opportunity. Hundreds of educational institutions offer online courses on thousands of promising areas in the field of nanotechnology, programming, photonics, robotics and much more. It remains only to choose the right one and fit exclusively for you.And we came to the next problem. Unfortunately, because of the large number of offers it can be very difficult to choose a truly worthwhile course. Each of us dreams of an enthusiastic teacher who will turn even the most boring topic into a real show. So how to guess with a choice? Personally, I can not fully trust the high marks and even comments under this or that course, because it’s always possible to connect bots that will vote as they need.It turns out that a system should be created that allows an honest and unbiased review of all existing courses and sites providing educational services. This is possible only through the direct participation of real people in a closed system, in which certain algorithms for rating are embedded as a consequence of the manifestation of trust.This approach can be realised only with the use of blockchain technology, which will ensure the transparency of the system and create conditions for maintaining the confidentiality and reliability of information contributed by participants in the system.Such a project exists, and very soon it goes to the ICO, after which it will begin to work with an extremely high probability, as an experienced team of developers from TeachMePlease, already established in the field of online education, is working on it.Site: https://teachmeplease.ru/The project is called DISCIPLINA.io. This is really the first blockchain for recruiting and education.Very much I advise to read White Paper of the project, having passed under this link: https://disciplina.io/WhitePaper_eng.pdfTerms of the ICO: 27.04–27.05.2018Softcap: 7 000 ETHHardcap: 34 000 ETHToken rate: 1 DSCP = 0,0005 ETHBOUNTY token distribution:Team of Project:Useful Links:SITE: https://disciplina.io/ONEPAGER: https://disciplina.io/pres-eng.pdfTECHNICALPAPER: https://disciplina.io/yellowpaper.pdfANN: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2325715BOUNTY: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3101698.0FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/tchmpls.events/TWITTER: https://twitter.com/tchmpls_eventsTELEGRAM: https://t.me/tchmplsINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tchmpls.events/YOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdRWnzR6WWEiaQlVqGHwOpgGITHUB: https://github.com/serokell/disciplina
