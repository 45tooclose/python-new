Cardano makes prove-of-stake algorithm security Breakthrough!NewsBTCCardano is a distributed computing platform that runs the blockchain for the Ada cryptocurrency. Today it’s the 6th most valuable cryptocurrency, and 3rd most valuable dApp platform.Charles Hoskinson yesterday tweeted that the IOHK team had solved the most teething problems of prove-of-stake algorithm, and that’s security.Cardano’s devs have always asserted that they would have the edge in security compared to other blockchain platforms. Cardano sees itself as a technological platform that will be capable of running financial applications currently used every day by individuals, organisations and governments all around the world. It’s basically a competitor to other smart contract platforms such as Ethereum, NEO, QTUM and others. Cardano is programmed in Haskell, a language best suited for business applications and data analysis, making its future applications likely to be financial or organizational.According to globalcoinreport, prove-of-stake is much better when it comes to scalability than proof-of-work which is why the advancements in question is a big deal for Cardano ADA. Basically, because of it, Cardano is one of the most secure and scalable blockchains on the market, and its security can even rival the one of Bitcoin.Given that prove-of-stake is way better than proof-of-work in terms of scalability, this advancement is a big breakthrough for Cardano ADA.Recent Google trends on Cardano show that interest in this crypto is going up. Google trends are usually a good indicator on the level of interest that investors have in a crypto. Using proof of stake for a cryptocurrency is a hotly debated design choice, however because it adds a mechanism to introduce secure voting, has more capacity to scale, and permits more exotic incentive schemes, Cardano embraced it.In the future of the smart contracts space, it’s thought that Cardano will out-compete the likes of Ethereum or NEO in scalability, and thus could rival them or overtake them one day. Cardano’s price currently is only $0.35, though its token is expected to rise considerably in 2018.
