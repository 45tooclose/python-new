4NEW Turning trash into cryptoSince March 31 2018, Bitcoin mining energy intake has officially surpassed the entire energy consumption of the country of Singapore, which ranks 43 globally in regards to energy consumption. As the difficulty of miningincreases to reflect the influx of miners joining the network, this energy consumption will increase.The most astounding aspect of this is that the rate of expansion is exponential. At the current rate of consumption, next year Bitcoin mining will consume enough energy to be listed as the twentieth country in the world by energyconsumption. The model is simply unsustainable. The world relies primarily on the production of energy from the burning of coal and oil, which not only damages the environment, but the economy as a whole. If Bitcoin has a greatenough impact on the world’s coal and oil supplies, the cost of a kilowatt will rise globally.The more valuable one bitcoin becomes, the more energy will be used to mine that coin, therefore with price spikes,come energy spikes.4NEW is the world’s first eco-friendly, tangible, blockchain ecosystem powered by waste to energy power plants. The concept is quite simple, the process of refining waste product into water and organic materials creates energy and that is then leveraged to either be sold to the national grid or applied to operate mining processes at an onsite mining farm.The cost to produce the energy is met through the revenue generated from the waste collection services and sale of byproducts facilitating a sustainable operation at breakeven or a marginal profit. Therefore, the energy produced is unencumbered and freely available for utilization or sale to the national grid.The exponential acceptance of the blockchain worldwide leading to a massive spike in energy consumption by cryptocurrency mining that could drive the price of energy up globally.4NEW has the unique opportunity to apply this finite lifetime supply of energy to its coin, namely, KWATT. The 4NEW coin symbol is KWATT. Each KWATT Coin embodies within it, 1 kilowatt of electricity for a year.You want to know more?4NEW website: https://4new.io/Whitepaper: https://4new.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/4NEW-WhitePaper.pdfTelegram: https://t.me/FRNCoin
