            French President Emmanuel Macron urged U.S. President Donald Trump to help fight climate change and to resist “aggressive nationalism” as he arrived at the White House for a state visit, wasting no time in cutting to the most divisive issues between the two leaders.No European leader has a better relationship with the president, and Macron hopes to tap that goodwill to persuade Trump not to abandon an international agreement to curb Iran’s nuclear program. He wasn’t able to keep the U.S. president from backing out of the Paris climate accord, but has nonetheless urged Trump to stick to American commitments to reduce carbon pollution.“It is together that we can resist the rise of aggressive nationalisms that deny our history and divide the world,” Macron said in French, according to a translation. “It is together that we will build a new, strong multilateralism that defends pluralism and democracy in the face of ill winds.”

        “We do not always agree on the solutions,” Macron said of climate change. “But it is also where the fate of our children is at stake.”Trump didn’t immediately respond to the remarks, delivered after Trump greeted him at a formal arrival ceremony at the White House. Trump welcomed Macron by celebrating “the wonderful friendship we have developed over the past year” which he said “is a testament to the enduring friendship” between the U.S. and France.He predicted that Macron “is going to be a great president of France.”Trump is delivering Macron the most lavish welcome for a foreign leader of his presidency so far, including his first state dinner. The fanfare is intended to rival Trump’s reception in France last year, where he attended Bastille Day celebrations and was feted with a military parade along the Champs-Élysées and dinner at the Eiffel Tower.
