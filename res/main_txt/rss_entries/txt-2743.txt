                    What is 'Bond Power'

      Bond power is a separate legal form that authorizes the transfer of ownership of a registered bond from one party to another, without endorsing the bond certificate. The bond power is essentially a substitute for the assignment on the back of the bond. It formally appoints an attorney-in-fact to transfer the ownership of the bonds.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Bond Power'
      A bond power form typically includes the previous owner's name, the total number of bonds, the bond issuer name, the bond principal amount, and the bond certificate number. A bond power usually requires a signature guarantee to protect against fraudulent transfers.
Bond powers are also sometimes referred to as an assignment separate from certificate. The separation of the power from the bond provides a measure of safety for the bondholder. The assignment allows lenders to sell any securities pledged as collateral against the bond should the borrower default.
In effect, a bond power serves the same purpose as the assignment form printed on the back of a registered bond certificate, but is more convenient because it may be exchanged, mortgaged, or sold separately from the certificate it represents. The power of attorney is given to the named entity so they can give the bond to whomever they wish.
In today’s digital marketplace, a retail investor will use a brokerage firm to buy or sell bonds and will rely on that firm to keep records of any legal documentation required for the transfer of the bond to the new owner. That means that most of the time the owner of a bond will not take physical possession of the bond certificate and does not have to complete legal paperwork to buy and sell bonds. The bonds are held in an electronic record with the broker's custodian eliminating the need for physical possession of the bond certificate. However, before technology allowed records to be kept entirely electronically, physical bond certificates were the norm and it was very common to use bond powers when transferring ownership of bonds from one party to another.
Example of ‘Bond Power’
For example, a bond power document would allow someone to sell or transfer bonds on behalf of the deceased's estate provided they are a personal representative, beneficiary, or executor. When someone passes away they often leave bonds as part of their assets. If those assets are still in the market a grant of authority may be needed to get them out, and a bond power document can simplify that process.
