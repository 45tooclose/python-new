            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will make a statement Monday evening on a “significant development” regarding the Iranian nuclear pact, his office said, as rising tensions between the two Middle Eastern powers stoke fears they’re headed for a military showdown in Syria.Israel has obtained a large trove of documents that officials say prove that Iran has misled the world regarding its nuclear program, Channel 2 reported, without saying how it obtained the information. Oil prices gained and Israeli stocks dropped after the announcement.Netanyahu’s announcement comes less than two weeks before President Donald Trump is to decide whether the U.S. will pull out of the international agreement to curb Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Israel sees the program as an existential threat, though Iran denies it’s developing a nuclear weapon.

        Israel has also said it will not allow Iran to entrench itself in Syria and has carried out dozens of attacks in recent years against Iranian weapons shipments through Syria bound for Hezbollah, its proxy militia in Lebanon. Overnight Sunday, at least 26 people were killed in a missile attack on Iranian and Syrian military positions in Syria that set off huge explosions, suggesting the site was a weapons depot.Israel, which traditionally refuses to confirm or deny its involvement in such attacks, hasn’t said whether it was behind the assault. Israel’s Security Cabinet held an emergency meeting Monday afternoon in Tel Aviv.The New York Times, citing an unnamed Israeli military official, reported Israel carried out an April 9 strike on an air base near Damascus that was said to house an Iranian military drone program. That came after Israel shot down an Iranian drone inside its airspace in February that the Israeli military said was armed and on its way to carry out an attack. Iran has denied dispatching the drone.

        The TA-35 Index fell as much as 1 percent Monday afternoon, before paring losses to 0.5 percent to 1466.26 at 5:06 p.m. in Tel Aviv. There are “a few jitters around, certainly,” said Guy Cordovi, head of international trading at Excellence Nessuah Brokerage Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “The escalating tension with Iran is raising concerns of a military confrontation between two regional powers, something that would drain Israeli resources and could lead to economic slowdown."
