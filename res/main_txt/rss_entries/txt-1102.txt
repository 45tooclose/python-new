Cryptocurrency markets may still be mired in the trough of disillusionment, but interest in blockchain and distributed ledger technology continues to percolate within the United States government. 
Applications of the technology across the federal government are being aggressively explored, in conjunction with artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotic process automation. 
But as public sector blockchain fever continues to grow - even amid reported instances of vendors trying to sell “blockchain solutions” that aren’t actually blockchain to naive agency IT procurement managers, a need has emerged for a roadmap and how-to manual designed to help practitioners better understand the technology’s potential, cuts through hype and jargon and ultimately deliver better value for taxpayers. 
 
  
ACT-IAC, a non-profit educational group that strives to help governments better utilize technology, has taken a first stab at this with the unveiling of its first-ever Blockchain Playbook for the federal government earlier this month. 
The white paper builds off the Modernization, Migration and Management shared services framework employed by the General Services Administration, which is used to guide agencies toward successful outcomes and reduced risk when pursuing technology upgrades. 
 
Developed by a broad team of agency technologists and outside experts and building off of the Blockchain Primer, released by ACT-IAC last fall to demonstrate the public sector pertinent capabilities that blockchain offers, the playbook seeks to serve as a guide rail for agencies curious about exploring and potentially deploying distributed ledgers in a calculated way. 
The playbook offers a five-stage roadmap for navigating blockchain’s unique potential benefits and pitfalls:
