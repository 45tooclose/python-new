Pending deposits are reportedly safe, however.Squashing BugsThe bug in question purportedly allows attackers to more easily manipulate price on the platform. Therefore, to protect market integrity on the platform, OKEx has stopped the flow of incoming ERC-20 tokens. In an official blog post, the company announced:We are suspending the deposits of all ERC-20 tokens due to the discovery of a new smart contract bug – “BatchOverFlow”. By exploiting the bug, attackers can generate an extremely large amount of tokens, and deposit them into a normal address. This makes many of the ERC-20 tokens vulnerable to price manipulations of the attackers.To protect public interest, we have decided to suspend the deposits of all ERC-20 tokens until the bug is fixed. Also, we have contacted the affected token teams to conduct investigation and take necessary measures to prevent the attack.If you have already made a deposit request on the platform, OKEx has assured users that their tokens are safe and sound:If you have already made a deposit request, your funds will arrive safely after our deposit service resumed. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.Changelly, another popular cryptocurrency trading service, has also suspended ERC20 token trading in response to the news of the exploit.Dear Customers, ERC20 tokens are temporarily unavailable due to an exploit check. We will bring them back, once we are sure there is no vulnerability in deposits received.
