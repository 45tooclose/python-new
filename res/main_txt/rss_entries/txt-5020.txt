(BABA) have been soaring to fresh all-time highs in recent months, and its not surprising that there are a number of options for the investor interested in ETFs holding Alibaba.
Alibaba shares grew by more than 57% over the past year as Chinese consumers shift their shopping habits toward internet retailers. About 15.5% of retail purchases were made online last year in China. E-commerce sales reached $749 billion in 2016 in China, up 26.2% from the year prior, according to the National Bureau of Statistics in China.

Active buyers on Alibaba’s China retail marketplace hit 454 million annually in the 2017 fiscal year that ended March 31. That’s up 11 million from the year prior. Now the world’s largest retailer, Alibaba has been increasing spending on video and entertainment to drive growth, and the company reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter earnings in May as a result. But revenue increased 60% to $5.6 billion, which is the highest revenue growth rate since its IPO in September 2014.
