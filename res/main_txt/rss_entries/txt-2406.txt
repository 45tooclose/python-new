If @tokenpay did not donate the deal does not happen. 2. @tokenpay has a partnership with @vergecurrency for our banking solution (we are buying bank in Germany). 3. More partnerships between crypto is important. TokenPay also benefits in helping large community, etc.— Derek Capo (@derekcapo) April 17, 2018“Great, thanks for helping make this happen,” Lee wrote in reply.This was the beginning of a sort of unofficial negotiation. “No problem,” Capo tweeted. “So when do you want to talk about a REAL debit card solution? We are buying 9.9% of a bank in Munich with option to buy 90%. We have a whole ecosystem and plan in place. Let me know how we can work together. The battle between old and new world is just getting started.”“They key to making this all work is ecosystems, partnerships and constant communication with regulators,” Capo continued. “Buying a bank in Germany gets us a seat at regulator table, key to educating governments. As for $LTC we can add to our bank, debit card, gift cards etc.”Lee then offered his own assistance and the assistance of the Litecoin Foundation with an invitation to Derek Capo to “DM” (direct message) him. Before Lee’s message to Finance Magnates, it was confirmed elsewhere online that Litecoin and TokenPay had entered into some sort of non-disclosure agreement.@SatoshiLite and @tokenpay NDA has been signed for potential partnership?
