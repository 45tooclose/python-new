The company has obtained the lucrative Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) license and has built a dedicated local team located in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC).The company’s strategic move positions it to diversify its geographic footprint at a critical time for the industry as the new European regulatory framework is getting closer to deployment.
