            President Donald Trump declared “Mission Accomplished!” hours after joint strikes on Syria by the U.S. and key allies, inviting immediate comparisons to President George W. Bush’s early, misplaced optimism about the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.“A perfectly executed strike last night,” Trump said in a Twitter message. “Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine military. Could not have had a better result. Mission accomplished!”The U.S., U.K. and France sought to shore up international support on Saturday after overnight strikes on Bashar al-Assad’s regime as punishment for an apparent chemical weapons attack, and as deterrence against future attacks.

        The Syrian government is believed to have been responsible for dropping a barrel bomb with chemical agents on a civilian population near Damascus a week ago. The coordinated missile attack by allied forces hit suspected weapons sites in an operation Trump said was intended to deter Assad from using chemical arms in future.The Pentagon said three primary targets, including a research center and weapons storage site, were hit.The words “Mission Accomplished” were famously displayed on a banner behind President Bush in an address from the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln in May 2003, in which he prematurely declared the end to major combat operations in Iraq.— With assistance by Donna Abu-Nasr, and Robert Hutton
