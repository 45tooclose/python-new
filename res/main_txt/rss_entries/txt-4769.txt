      An intermarket ppread wwap is the exchange of two bonds within different parts of the same market that can help produce a more favorable yield spread. One bond is sold in order to purchase a different kind that is seen as “better”; essentially, it is “swapped” out for another kind of bond.
An intermarket spread wwap is a swap transaction meant to capitalize on a yield discrepancy between bond market sectors. Intermarket spread swaps are based upon expectations of yield spreads between different bond sectors or spots on the yield curve. By entering a swap, parties are able to gain exposure to the underlying bonds, without having to directly hold the securities. An intermarket spread swap can also be used as a strategy to try to improve an investor’s position.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Intermarket Spread Swap'
      Opportunities for intermarket spread swaps exist when there are credit quality or feature differences between bonds. For example, if there is a wide credit spread between high credit quality corporate and treasury bonds, and the spread is expected to narrow, investors would swap government securities for corporate securities. One party would pay the yield on corporate bonds while the other the treasury rate plus the initial spread. As the spread widens or narrows, the parties will begin to gain or lose on the swap.
Example of an intermarket spread swap
An example of an Intermarket Spread Swap could occur in situation when the investment rate of return on a bond changes, so the investor “swaps” it out for the better-performing kind. For example, if a one type bond has historically seen a 2 percent return rate, but the yield spread reveals a 3 percent difference, the investor might consider “swapping,” or essentially selling, the bond to try to narrow the difference and yield a higher profit.
Limitations of an intermarket spread swap
One important consideration of an intermarket spread swap is for the investor to consider what is the driving the difference in the yield spread. Typically, bonds yields tend to rise when their prices fall, but a smart investor will also take into consideration just what is driving those dropping prices. For example, during times of recession, a wide yield spread could actually represent the perceived higher risk of that bond instead of just some bargain pricing. Purchasing what actually boils down to high risk bonds is a decision that should not be taken lightly by investors.
