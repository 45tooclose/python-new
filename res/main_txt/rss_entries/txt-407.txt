Williams (@JWilliamsFstmed) April 9, 2018Earlier this year, cryptocurrency investment firm BlockTower Capital hired Michael Bucella, former Vice President of Multi-Asset and Global Equity Sales at Goldman. Matthew Goetz, who served as Vice President at Goldman for 11 years, formed BlockTower Capital in 2017.Novogratz’ Rise in the CryptosphereNovogratz himself worked at Goldman in the late 1990s, and formed Galaxy Digital earlier this year after a long career in Wall Street. In January, Novogratz described Galaxy as a “best-in-class, full service, institutional quality merchant banking business.”Prior to the announcement of Galaxy Digital, Novogratz developed plans to create a $500 million crypto hedge fund last year–a plan that was abruptly halted in late December. At the time, Novogratz said that “we didn’t like market conditions and we wanted to re-evaluate what we’re doing.” The decision to table the fund came in the massive Bitcoin crash that followed its journey up to $20,000.Novogratz has been making headlines for the past several months for his Bitcoin predictions, some of which have come true. In November of 2017, he predicted that Bitcoin would reach $10,000 by year’s end; before he decided to cancel the launch of the crypto hedge fund, Novogratz told CNBC that he believed Bitcoin could “easily” reach $40,000 by the end of 2018.With the price of Bitcoin tanking and then stabilizing around $7000 for the past several weeks, many feel that a rise to $40,000 by the end of this year is a rather lofty goal. Then again, Bitcoin was at just $1180 a year ago today; if it continues to rise at the same rate (a 600% increase), Bitcoin will be worth $42,000 next April. Maybe the future isn’t as bleak as it seems to be. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: 2018 / blockchain / crypto / crypto exchange / novogratzRelated News First Soros Invests in Cryptocurrency and Now Rockefeller – Is Buffett Next?
