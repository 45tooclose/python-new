      A goldbricker is a person who gets paid a wage or salary for work that is not actually done, despite the appearance of working. The term originates from the unscrupulous practice of coating bricks of cheap metals with gold plate, in order to pass them off as solid gold. Thus a worker who seems hard at work might actually be tending to personal matters.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Goldbricker'
      Goldbricking today most often refers to employees who use company time to scour the internet or perform other personal tasks. But it can also refer to public or union employees who are intentionally paid not to work. For example, in New York City recently it was reported that about 700 teachers accused of various on-the-job offenses were paid to do nothing for months or years while their cases were being decided. What makes it goldbricking is that the teachers were still required to report to work and thus give the appearance of labor. In fact they sat in a so-called rubber room for eight hours, doing nothing. The policy costs city taxpayers an estimated $65 million a year.
Goldbricking Is Also Called Cyber Slacking
In the United States, goldbricking is estimated to cost companies billions of dollars a year. A 2007 survey by Salary.com revealed that about six out of 10 employees in the United States acknowledged wasting time at work. Internet use, sometimes called cyber slacking, was the leading time-wasting activity in the workplace, and 34 percent of respondents admitted to it. Employees cited boredom, long hours, lack of challenge and inadequate pay as the reasons for why they failed to spend this time working. 
The boon in social networking sites like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, as well as texting, has contributed to goldbricking habits. Workers who want to socialize on the job no longer need to stand around the water cooler or pick up the phone; they can just go online. Companies are fighting back with surveillance software that can monitor employee internet searches, or by installing proxy servers that block social media and other websites. However the ubiquity of smartphones has complicated restriction efforts, since employees can simply browse cyberspace on their own devices.
Goldbricking has become such a serious issue that it is impacting larger labor and societal dynamics. For example, in 2013 Yahoo announced it would prohibit telecommuting because it found that employees who worked from home were not logging into the company servers as often as office-based workers.
