      A doomsday call is a call option that is added to a bond and allows the issuer or investor to redeem the bond early. It can be spotted by the mention of the phrase DD call in a bond quote. Despite the gloomy sound of the name, this often has positive connotations because the investor will sometimes exercise this rate when certain conditions are favorable and they want to cash in when their return is likely to be relatively high.
The doomsday call is also referred to as the Canada call because bonds issued by Canadian corporations often include them. When the call is exercised, the issuer pays back the principal and accrued interest before maturity.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Doomsday Call'
      A doomsday call, when exercised, can reduce the yield of a bond because it shortens the term of the bond and, therefore, decreases the overall interest paid. It is fairly uncommon for a bond issuer to invoke a doomsday call, as it is generally to the issuer’s advantage to allow the bond to continue to maturity. However, if interest rates should decrease significantly, it may be to the issuer’s benefit to exercise a doomsday call because they can then go on to issue new bonds at the lower interest rate.
Nevertheless, the doomsday call provision ensures that the price paid for the bond creates a specific yield for the bondholder and the exercise of one reduces risk, since it pays the principal back early.
A doomsday call option can help protect the bondholder because it specifies what the investor will get if the issuer exercises this option. This stipulation usually dictates that will be called at a fixed, predetermined amount. This is either a certain spread over the yield of government bonds or par value, whichever is higher.
The history of the doomsday call
While today the term doomsday call is most commonly known as a Canada call, it was once also known by a different name, related to the company that first came up with the idea. According to financial industry lore, this type of call of option got its start when a company named Domtar first issued bonds with this feature back in 1987. Domtar is a Canadian manufacturer of paper products. From those origins, it was eventually dubbed a doomsday call. Some who feel that moniker is too morbid or negative prefer to refer to it as a Canada call, a name that has caught on and is viewed more positively. .
