      Breaking Down 'North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA)'
      NASAA seeks to help investors identify and avoid fraud by educating the public, investigating violations of state and provincial law and filing enforcement actions. Its membership is made up of regulators that may be appointed, hired for career-focused positions, or under the jurisdiction of their states' Attorneys General. They are "responsible for licensing securities firms and investment professionals, such as broker-dealers and investment advisers, registering certain securities offerings, reviewing financial offerings of small companies, auditing branch office sales practices and record-keeping, promoting investor education, and most importantly, enforcing state securities laws," according to NASAA. In addition to protecting investors, some state regulators may help small businesses raise money and stay in compliance with securities laws. Some regulators may work in a department that also regulates insurance or banking. NASAA's membership is made up of securities regulators from all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Canada and Mexico.
NASAA's website features a variety of investor and professional resources, including a fraud center that lists top investor traps, a fraud awareness quiz, fraud red flags, how to contact a local securities regulator, and how to investigate a broker or investment adviser.
North American Securities Administrators Association: Key Activities
NASAA members work within the government to protect investors and ensure the integrity of the securities industry in the following ways:
Licensing stockbrokers, investment adviser firms (those managing less than $100 million in assets), and securities firms that conduct business in the state.
Registering certain securities offered to the states’ investors.
Investigating investor complaints and potential cases of investment fraud
Enforcing state securities laws by fining, penalizing, providing restitution to investors, prosecuting white-collar criminals, and imposing legally binding conduct remedies designed to correct specific problems.
Examining brokerage and investment adviser firms to ensure compliance with securities laws and maintenance of accurate records of client accounts.
Reviewing certain offerings that are not exempt from state law.
Educating investors about their rights and providing the tools and knowledge they need to make informed financial decisions.
Advocating passage of strong, sensible, and consistent state securities laws and regulations.
NASAA also administers the Series 63, 65 and 66 examinations, which licenses finance professionals to function as an agent. In most states, the Series 63 is a requirement for securities agents.
