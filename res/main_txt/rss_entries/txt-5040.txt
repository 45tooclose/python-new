            A court in Budapest obliged Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government to apologize to a human rights organization for making false statements about it in the buildup to last month’s elections, in a rare victory for NGOs amid an increasing official crackdown.The government has to publish an apology in a central part of its official website kormany.hu for 30 days for harming the reputation of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee in materials distributed to 8 million voters, the committee said on its Facebook page, citing the court ruling. The court also upheld a lower court’s other penalties including compensation of 2 million forints ($7,600).Orban won a third consecutive term in April after a campaign obsessed with the threat of immigration and what he calls a "shadow army" of NGOs financed by Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros. According to the court ruling, a self-styled survey of voters by the government falsely alleged the Helsinki Committee was protecting immigrants who committed crimes, using Soros’s funds, the committee said.
