Crypto naysers who think Bitcoin is “the ultimate bubble” love to point at so-called HODLers and laugh. 
HODLers are crypto investors who buy and hold their positions regardless of price. Whether the market is up, down or sideways, these folks stay invested, confident in the long-term value of crypto. The term was created in 2013 in a Bitcoin chat forum by an investor who was watching Bitcoin’s price fall sharply but decided not to sell. He wrote a post titled, “I am HODLing,” meaning to write “HOLDing.” 
The misspelling caught on with the Bitcoin community. Eventually, working backward, they turned it into an evocative acronym: Hold On for Dear Life. Anyone who has watched Bitcoin’s recent volatility knows that the acronym can sometimes feel spot-on. 
To the mainstream investment community, however, it’s the epitome of crypto insanity. You can almost hear them tut-tutting from behind their mahoganied desks: 
Look at these fools, holding their imaginary money with no regard to price. They just sit there and watch while their portfolios fall by 50% or more. Insanity! 
 
  
But HODLing is actually the only valid strategy for most crypto investors. After all, it’s just “buy and hold” in an updated wrapper. 
Consider that, on the day the term HODLing was first mentioned, Bitcoin prices fell 24.67%, part of a 46% slide that took place from Dec. 10 to Dec. 18. You can see why people were panicked. 
But Bitcoin prices are up 1,338% since that time. While it hasn’t been a direct path—prices tumbled to $183 by Aug. 18, 2015, before staging a massive rally—if the person who coined HODL had $10,000 invested in Bitcoin at that time, it would be worth $143,829 today. 
 
Who’s laughing now?
