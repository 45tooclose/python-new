      The departmental overhead rate is an expense rate for every department in a factory production process. The departmental rate is different at every stage of the production process when various departments perform selected steps to complete the final process. By breaking up overhead for individual business sections rather than having a company-wide rate, management can assess corporate inefficiencies more accurately.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Departmental Rate '
      The departmental rate is specific to every segregated step in the entire process. For example, if a company makes bread, different departmental rates could be used for the actual production/manufacturing line and the bagging process.
Cost-cutting, efficiency and productivity are standard elements of a strong corporate performance methodology. Analysis and benchmarking of departmental overhead rates is an effective way to measure success. Comparisons between competitors, as well as among various internal departments help isolate efforts that are adding value, and those that are destroying enterprise value.
No two approaches are the same. Like all things in business, there are pros and cons to the myriad of strategies businesses can utilize. However, by following trends in departmental rates, patterns do emerge highlighting the delicate balance of short-term goals with long-term business requirements.
Determining appropriate departmental rates is an area addressed by managerial accounting methods. Whereby, managerial accounting is the process of identifying, measuring, analyzing, interpreting and communicating information for the pursuit of an organization's goals. This branch of accounting is also known as cost accounting. The key difference between managerial and financial accounting is managerial accounting information is aimed at helping managers within the organization make decisions, while financial accounting is aimed at providing information to parties outside the organization.
In managerial accounting, rather than using one overhead rate to allocate all of the overhead costs, overhead costs can be broken down by departments. Departmental overhead rates offer the flexibility to use a different activity or cost driver for each department. Often, some departments will rely heavily on manual labor while others require more machinery. Direct labor hours can be important to certain departments but machine hours might work better for others.
