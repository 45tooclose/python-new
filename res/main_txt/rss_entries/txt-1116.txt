        Pence has been without a national security adviser for months after Andrea Thompson resigned and was nominated by Trump to a senior post in the State Department.Lerner will continue to advise Pence informally while remaining on Haley’s team, according to a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Pence prides himself on operating without drama so he accepted Lerner’s decision to withdraw in order to avoid distraction, the official said.The personnel flap is a rare example of Pence and Trump publicly butting heads. Pence has spent much of his time in office effusively defending the president, often reinterpreting Trump’s most controversial statements in ways that are less inflammatory.And while Trump has seen a rash of personnel drama and turnover among his staff --including three national security advisers in 15 months -- Pence had mostly avoided such controversy to this point.
