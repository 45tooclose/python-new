            President Donald Trump has a new idea for the location of a potential meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un: the Peace House on the heavily fortified border separating North and South Korea."Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING, but would Peace House/Freedom House, on the Border of North & South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country? Just asking!" Trump said in a Twitter posting Monday.Trump had previously said potential locations for the historic meeting had been whittled down to two or three locations. The president has said he hopes to meet with Kim by early June to try to resolve a standoff between Washington and Pyongyang over North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.

        Panmunjom, also known as the Peace House, is already an historic location, having been the site of the signing of the 1953 armistice ending the Korean War fighting. Kim and South Korea’s Moon Jae-in met in that location last week after Kim walked across the military demarcation line.The two countries agreed to hold talks aimed at formally ending the 70-year state of war that has existed between them and this weekend Kim said his country aims to shutter its main nuclear testing site in May.
