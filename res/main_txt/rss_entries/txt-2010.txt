This will boost throughput and resilience between Fidessa applications and customer firms’ Solace messaging infrastructure.Fidessa has been using Solace for years as its messaging platform and has now integrated GS3 (Global Switching, Security and Service Integration) middleware with the Solace platform. This will provide inbound and outbound data across the full suite of Fidessa applications, and across all hubs in Fidessa’s globally distributed installations.Get free trading education!Mentioning this integration, Fidessa’s Director of Group Strategy Steve Grob said: “The rapid take-up of Solace technology across our customer base aligns with our approach of making available key components of Fidessa architecture to top-tier firms. Combined with other initiatives, this enables firms to deploy new systems without the usual headaches in terms of integration, change control and IP delivery.”Performance accelerated selloutEarlier this year, Fidessa agreed to a takeover by Swiss fintech ‎company Temenos in a deal worth up to £1.4 billion ($1.96 billion). This came after the firm’s announcement of a year-on-year revenue increase of seven percent, reaching £353.9 million.Moreover, Fidessa last month launched a new service, called BlockShadow, with an aim to place orders across various venues simultaneously, including dark markets. This centralized service manager was introduced to ensure the best possible execution of positions across several venues, as well as to prevent over-fill of orders that would exceed the desired volume.“A key part of our success has been that the Solace interface is the same regardless of where data resides, be it on-site or in the cloud. Our partnership with Fidessa makes our proposition even more powerful by providing tangible, real-world advantage,” Keith McAuliffe, General Manager of Financial Services at Solace, added. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: fidessa / fintechRelated News Cybercriminal Sentenced to 36 Months for Botched Government Hacking Scheme  Lloyds to Close Branches and Cut Over 300 Jobs  Fidessa Launches BlockShadow Service for Dark Pool Trading  Got a news tip?
