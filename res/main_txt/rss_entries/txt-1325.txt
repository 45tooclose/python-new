            The U.S. Supreme Court threw out a provision in federal immigration law that was used to deport foreigners convicted of serious crimes.The justices, on a splintered vote, said the law’s definition of "crime of violence" was so vague as to be unconstitutional. People convicted of a violent crime are subject to mandatory deportation, meaning government officials don’t have discretion to let them stay.
