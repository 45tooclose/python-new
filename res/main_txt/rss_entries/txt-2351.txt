        Morgan highlighted the case of Barclays Plc, where the gender pay gap is 48 percent and 79 percent when it comes to discretionary bonuses at its international unit.“Doesn’t it concern you that women at Barclays, for example, are paid about three times less in terms of bonuses than men?" she asked.“Yes,” Hammond replied.But after several attempts to elicit outrage from the chancellor, Hammond offered his view that the pay gap was “not justified and needs to close.”— With assistance by Jill Ward
