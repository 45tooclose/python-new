        “We would like to reiterate the statement of the Secretary of Foreign Affairs that the palace is equally disturbed by the latest developments involving the recall of our ambassador to Kuwait,” Harry Roque, official spokesman for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, told reporters.Relations between the Philippines and Kuwait, where more than 250,000 Filipinos work, have been rocky since the body of Filipina domestic worker Joanna Demafelis was found inside a freezer in an abandoned apartment in February. Demafelis’ body bore signs of torture.While the Philippines was forced to apologize earlier this week after Ambassador Villa made public statements angering Kuwaiti authorities, Roque said the government was “convinced that all kinks” in the bilateral relationship had been ironed out.“We hope that this development will not lead to the further worsening of bilateral ties between the two countries,” Roque added.President Duterte said earlier this month that he planned to travel to Kuwait for the signing of an agreement that would help to protect Filipino workers in the future.
