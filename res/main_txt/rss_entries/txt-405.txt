Samoan Central Bank Strikes Against OneCoin Scam Samoa is only the latest in a growing group of countries to take action against the suspected scheme.    Rachel McIntosh  |  News ( CryptoCurrency )  |   Tuesday, 10/04/2018 | 07:50 GMT   Photo: OneCoinShare this articleThe Samoan central bank has become the latest institution to launch an investigation against OneCoin, a suspected cryptocurrency pyramid scheme based in Bulgaria.“[OneCoin] is a snare that is used to catch people’s money,” said Maiava Atalina Ainu’u-Enari, governor of the Central Bank of Samora in a report by the Samoa Observer last week. Officials are in the process of investigating whether or not OneCoin has been successfully reeling in investors with false promises of outrageously high returns.Join our Telegram channel and get all the latest cryptocurrency news directly to your phone!The Observer also mentioned that several prominent “Church Ministers” may be implicated in the investigation, but Ainu’u-Enari did not deny or confirm the rumor.The Central Bank of Samoa also issued an official warning against OneCoin and other “risky” cryptocurrency investments on the 21st of March: “CBS, as the Regulator for financial institutions in Samoa, does not wish to prohibit new ventures that will benefit Samoa’s public and economy; however, as with every new venture such as cryptocurrency, there are always risks involved.A Growing List of Counts Against OneCoinOneCoin has all of the trappings of a cryptocurrency scheme; a flashy homepage emblazoned with the words “Join the Financial Revolution”; promises that the OneCoin blockchain network (which doesn’t actually exist, by the way) is “easy and safe” to use. Taking full advantage of the blockchain buzz, “affiliates” in cities around the world encourage innocent people to invest now, before it’s “too late.”A look into the company’s past also reveals myriad dishonest dealings and suspicious activities from the executives of the company, including OneCoin founder Dr. Ruja Ignatova, who stepped down from her position in the company after being arrested in India last year.As Finance Magnates previously reported, authorities in Finland, Pakistan, India, Bulgaria, Italy, and others have taken legal aim at OneCoin over the past several months; the Italian AntiTrust Authority (IAA) watchdog group went so far as to fine the organization $2.59 million euros last year. Authorities in even more countries have issued warnings against investing in the scheme.#Onecoin scam has nothing to do with any “cryptocurrency” movement. Only the fake #KleptoCurrency movement €6.5 TRILLION??? pic.twitter.com/ePqEbyuWbl— Tim Tayshun (@ezCoinAccess) October 19, 2017OneCoin’s “home base” was raided by Bulgarian authorities in late January of 2018; roughly fifty people were taken in for questioning.Because OneCoin is officially incorporated in the UAE, it has been allowed to continue its operations in spite of the increasing number of countries that have taken some kind of legal action against the company. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: Bitcoin Scam / blockchain / cryptocurrency / OneCoin / ScamRelated News First Soros Invests in Cryptocurrency and Now Rockefeller – Is Buffett Next?
