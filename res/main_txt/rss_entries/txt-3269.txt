      BREAKING DOWN 'New York Futures Exchange - NYFE'
      The New York Futures Exchange – NYFE was founded as the volume of futures contracts traded for non-physical commodities began to grow. Before the late 1970s and early 1980s, financially based futures contracts for stock indices, currencies, and government bonds did not exist.
As interest grew in trading contracts such as these, the New York Stock Exchange established the NYFE to begin trading U.S. Treasury bond futures and stock index futures based on the NYSE Composite Index.
Surging Growth in Trading Financial Futures
During the early 1980s, NYFE introduced futures contracts on more specialized indices, such as the NYSE Small Composite Index and introduced trading in options on various futures contracts. Then in 1994, the New York Cotton Exchange (NYCE) bought NYFE.
In 1998, NYCE and Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange (CSCE) merged to become the New York Board of Trade (NYBOT). Contracts that NYFE had introduced began trading on that exchange.
Then in 2007, the New York Board of Trade was acquired by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which renamed its futures contracts, now called ICE Futures.
Although futures contracts, mainly for agricultural products, have been traded since the 19th century, the growth in trading of futures and options based on financial indices and derivatives has outpaced those for physical products.
Interest in trading currency futures grew as the Bretton Woods exchange rate regime established as World War II ended became less relevant with more currencies floating freely against others. And because of severe inflation in the 1970s, financial professionals sought tools such as futures contracts on bonds to hedge against interest rate risk.
And as more stock market indices were introduced for both U.S. and global markets, investors adopted indexing strategies, sometimes using futures contracts to follow the performance of these indices. In addition, the popularity of derivatives such as options grew, not only options on individual stocks, but options on indices, currencies and futures contracts.
What was established as a small subsidiary of the New York Stock Exchange in 1980, pioneering the trading of nonphysical futures contracts, NYFE and the organizations that acquired it over the intervening years has grown into a business that helps investors and traders worldwide take advantage of hedging strategies across global markets.
