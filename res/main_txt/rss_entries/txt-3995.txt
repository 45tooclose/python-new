Vitalik Buterin Discusses Sharding Proof of Concept Sharding is a way to help a blockchain cope as it gets bigger and heavier.

Ethereum uses a proof of work system, meaning that all transactions must be processed by all nodes in the system. This is the system used by the original cryptocurrency and is a tried and tested way of upholding the integrity of the blockchain, but it makes the network heavy and slow. Many solutions to this problem have been proposed and launched – larger blocks, child blockchains and the Lightning Network are just some examples.Sharding, as the name implies, basically means that the blockchain will be fragmented, lightening the workload of validation nodes. At the beginning of 2018 the Ethereum Foundation launched two research and development programmes to develop sharding protocols, funded by subsidies of between $50,000 and $1 million.The most recent proof of concept discusses a mechanism that can be “bolted on top of the current ethereum main chain”.Source: ethresear.chA proof of stake-powered beacon-chain will be tied to the main chain. The beacon will act as a heartbeat, issuing new shard-blocks every 2-8 seconds. These new blocks will randomly suggest a node to verify it, and that node will have the choice of creating a shard collation or not. The verifying node is randomly chosen but the randomness is affected by that node’s activity. This latter is the hallmark of the proof of stake consensus system. Apart from lightening the workload of the network, it has the added advantage of ensuring the stability of the system because those who are active hold coins and thus have incentive to uphold the system.It should be noted that each new block, of any type, will be dependent on a block from the main chain. However the main blockchain does not personally verify every transaction – they are verified by proxy; that is, by randomly selected validators.Buterin adds: “A not yet fully solved challenge is determining how to incentivize and when to allow cross-links.” googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: bitcoin / blockchain / Ethereum / plasma / scalability / sharding / vitalik buterinRelated News Exclusive: Charlie Lee Confirms Exploring Bank Acquisition with TokenPay  Revolut Adds Bitcoin Cash and Ripple Trading, Raises $250 Million  UK’s Largest Crypto Firms Implore MPs to Regulate  Got a news tip?
