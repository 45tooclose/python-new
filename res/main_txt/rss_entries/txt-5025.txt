      N.V. is an acronym for the Dutch phrase "Naamloze Vennootschap," which is the equivalent of a public company.  N.V. is used in the Netherlands, Belgium, Suriname, the Dutch West Indies, Indonesia, Curacao, St. Maarten, and Aruba.  Naamloze vennootschap means "nameless venture," which is befitting since the shareholders in a public company can maintain anonymity.

      BREAKING DOWN 'N.V. (Naamloze Vennootschap)'
      In an N.V., two or more shareholders invest capital. Two spouses may incorporate an NV, provided the memorandum of association does not conflict with the matrimonial regime. However, naming of the company after any of its partners is not allowable.
Establishing an NV requires the appointment of three or more directors. If the incorporation is by two founders or there are only two shareholders, the board may have two members. Because the N.V. is a legal entity, the creation of a financial plan is necessary. The opening of a  particular account in the company’s name will receive all cash contributions. In the case of contributions in kind, an auditor’s report is necessary.
The drafting of an official deed is done before a notary. The filing of articles of incorporation with the registrar must happen within 15 days of corporation creation. The registrar will then arrange for publication in the Belgian Official Gazette. 
The company enrolls in the "register of legal entities" kept at the commercial court registry. Also, the registry will assign the company an enterprise number. If the company engages in commercial activities, it registers as a trader at the Crossroads Bank for Enterprises via a business counter.
Pros and Cons of an NV
An NV is useful in protecting the identity of the investor. Because partner and shareholder liability is limited to individual contributions, personal assets are not at risk. However, the decision-making process is more complicated, and accounting obligations are more substantial than with other business structures. 
Shares are registered until fully paid up so, no outlay of cash is required. However, this will necessitate a high amount of fully invested starting capital from the point the company is incorporated. Furthermore, each share corresponding to a cash contribution must be at least one-fourth paid up.
The articles of association authorize conversion of registered securities to bearer securities. Although bearer shares are transferable, registered shares are exchangeable but may be limited. 
For example, an approval clause in the articles of incorporation requires the approval of share transfers by a company body, typically management. A preemption clause requires shareholders giving other shareholders first rights to purchase shares. An alienability clause means share transfers are limited in time and must be justified by the company’s interests.
