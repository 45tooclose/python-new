His move comes after he spent the last two years building the corporate and financial division of Stature PR, two areas where the agency has registered material growth in the past several quarters.Mr Campbell joins BTL Group as a Senior Manager of the Corporate Affairs and Communication division. The company is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange’s venture division under the ticker BTL.The firm is currently developing its core product, Interbit, a next-generation blockchain platform that is aiming to facilitate businesses. With office locations in London, Vancouver and Calgary, the company is developing a multi-chain platform which is focused on joining capability between thousands of Interbit blockchains to enable scalable security, data integrity, and privacy. The official release date for Interbit has been set by the company to the 23rd of April.Addressing Blockchain ScalabilityInterbit’s chain-joining capability allows the platform it to run multiple blockchains. With scalability being one of the main challenges for blockchain technology at present, BTL’s approach is aimed at securing adequate speed and scale that is still a problem for conventional blockchains.The product is built to be easily integrated and adopted in a common coding language. BTL Group is already working with several large corporations from the finance and energy sectors.Elaborating on his move, Mr Campbell shared with Finance Magnates: “My move to BTL reminds me of the time I first started in the City when the internet bubble had just burst and then followed the realization of the true value of that technology. The retail broking sector and online trading went through a seismic change and I remember so clearly how telephone trading almost stopped overnight as clients suddenly shifted to their computers to trade online.”“It was great to be in the thick of it, from helping to develop new platforms to running sales and communications teams throughout my time in that industry. Blockchain technology has the same feel about it as companies are reimagining ways they can work with blockchains to make workflows and processes far more efficient.”“My two and a half years at Stature were very rewarding and I built the Corporate & Financial division into one of the biggest growth areas of the agency. They are fast becoming known as one of the providers of communications and media relations for fintech firms, more specifically blockchain technology companies. The team there is set to grow as they search for people with the appropriate experience to maintain that momentum and I wish them all the very best,” Mr Campbell elaborated on his work with Stature PR.Angus will continue to hold his position as a non-executive director of OTF Holdings. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: blockchain / londonRelated News EVERFX Taps Georgios Karoullas as its Chief Operations Officer  Exclusive: Brian Myers Resigns as CEO of GKFX  First Soros Invests in Cryptocurrency and Now Rockefeller – Is Buffett Next?
