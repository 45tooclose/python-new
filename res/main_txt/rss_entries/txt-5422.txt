																		Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett reiterated his support for Apple's plan to buy back more of its own shares.
															
																													
					
			
	
												    														On Tuesday, the smartphone maker announced a new $100 billion stock buyback program.
															
																										    														"When I buy Apple, I know that Apple is going to repurchase a lot of shares," Buffett said on CNBC's "Squawk Box" Monday, following Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting. "We own about 5 percent. But I know I don't have to do a thing and probably in a couple of years we'll own 6 percent without laying out another dollar. Well, I love the idea of having 5 percent go to 6 percent. The cheaper the stock is the more they will get for their money. There is no reason at all for me to encourage other people to buy Apple."
