      Commoditization refers to the process of making something a commodity. It removes individual, unique characteristics and brand identity, so that the product becomes interchangeable with other products of the same type, so competition occurs only on price, not on other characteristics. When a financial contract such as a mortgage becomes commoditized, the contract becomes liquid because it can be bought and sold easily. This promotes trading in that market because the contracts do not have to be assessed individually and treated uniquely.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Commoditization'
      Commoditization is an action that strips a good or service of differentiating characteristics. The good or service becomes indistinguishable from others in that same category. There are three conditions that must be met for a good or service to become a commodity:
It must be standardized so there are no variations. Agricultural products must be in a raw state. For example, corn is a commodity, but light corn syrup is not.
It must be usable when purchased, without requiring processing or alterations. Corn is a commodity but stalks of corn on the cob in the husk is not.
It must vary enough in price that a market develops for it. Corn is a commodity because the price fluctuates and varies, but something that all costs the same amount without regulation or pressures is not.
Commoditization happens when a good or service can be standardized enough to be purchased as a transaction instead of customized. In finance, a financial contract such as a bond or loan undergoes commoditization when it is no longer necessary to become involved in all the varied terms of the bond or loan. In the example of a mortgage, the loan can be unique to the borrower, but a commodity to an investor who buys mortgages as investments.
Effects of Commoditization
Commoditization creates a more liquid market because it makes it easier to buy and sell whatever the commodity is. Without involved sales processes based on differentiation and brand identities or individual characteristics, purchases of the commodity become transactional and more simple, and they increase in volume. This increased selling volume may create more variability in price of the commodity, but it also generates more activity and injects cash into the market.
In the example of mortgage loans, the increase in buying and selling of these loans increases the amount of cash circulating and available, and allows banks and other lenders to make more loans to more borrowers. This is beneficial for the industry as a whole as well as for borrowers..
