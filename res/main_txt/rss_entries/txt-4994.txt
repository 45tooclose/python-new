Later, with the decline in prices towards the end of January, I continued to build positions, continued to buy. Now this small goal has basically been achieved.A New Hodler In The MakingCai is an example of ‘big money’ choosing its moment to enter the Bitcoin market, something which is tipped to occur en masse in the west as the year continues.Bitcoin prices have staged a broad recovery in April, a move which has given a palpable sense of optimism to traders, investors and industry figures.Even before the uptick in March as prices hovered around $7000, Fundstrat cofounder Tom Lee’s Bitcoin Misery Index became a symbol of Bitcoin’s oversold status, Lee telling mainstream consumers that the time could not be better to buy the cryptocurrency.In a tweet this week, Charlie Shrem even went as far as to suggest that May 2018 would be “the last time” BTC/USD would ever trade below $10,000.For Cai meanwhile, careful detachment of “investors” from “speculators” in Bitcoin is key.“I think the biggest difference between investment and speculation is that when you buy a stock or a digital currency and the price keeps falling, your mentality is more or less positive and you can make up short positions,” he continued. “That’s investment and vice versa. Getting deflated and complaining about price capitulation is speculation.”What do you think about Cai Wenshang’s Bitcoin investment?
