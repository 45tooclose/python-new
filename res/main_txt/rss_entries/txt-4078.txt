Earlier this year, the IRS reminded that capital gains from cryptocurrency shall be taxed under the regulations governing property.At the same time, the taxman also said:Virtual currency, as generally defined, is a digital representation of value that functions in the same manner as a country’s traditional currency.However, Giancarlo sheds some light on the matter, pointing out that different regulatory regimes might define cryptocurrencies as different asset classes:We see elements of commodity in it that are subject to our regulations, but depending on which regulatory regime you’re looking at, it has different aspects of all of that. The chairman of the CFTC points out that both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the CFTC are operating under old regulations, established back in the 1930s. Needless to say, Bitcoin is not even 10 years old, while other cryptocurrencies have come to light in the recent years, and even months.Giancarlo also points out that it’s the Congress who’s ultimately responsible for making the decision whether or not these new asset classes are to require new policies.So, What’s the Deal?It seems that for the time being, nothing has changed. A lot has been said but not a lot has been done, as regulators are still trying to identify the most accurate approach when it comes to putting the crypto field in certain legislative frameworks.However, it goes without saying that hearing a high-collar CFTC official openly stating that “Bitcoin would be better suited for a long-term buy and hold strategy” is music to our ears.Do you think further regulations are needed to stabilize the market?
