In the fast-moving world of FinTech, announcements are made daily about this new universe, not least the cities and countries that are trying to position themselves as FinTech hubs. 
Currently, London and Singapore are probably the two territories that are scrambling to be FinTech Royalty, not least by investment in startups, but also by environments that encourage speedy innovation. 
The Bank of England is one institution that is putting its considerable weight and history behind the FinTech future. 
It clearly has form and tradition behind it. Established in 1694, it’s the world’s second oldest bank, behind the somewhat less-well known Sveriges Riksbank. 
Nicknamed the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street (where it is based in the City of London), this Old Lady means business and this morning embraced the somewhat younger FinTech world. 
While the announcement was somewhat arcane, the Bank of England has granted P2P money transfer company TransferWise as the first non-bank payment services provider to hold a settlement account in the Bank of England’s Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system. 
 
  
This means that TransferWise is the first non-bank direct member of the Faster Payments Scheme (FPS).  
Co-founded by Taavet Hinrikus and Kristo Käärmann, TransferWise launched in 2011. It is one of the best-funded global FinTech startups having raised nearly $400 million from investors such as IVP, Old Mutual, Andreessen Horowitz, Sir Richard Branson, Valar Ventures and Max Levchin of PayPal. 
According to the company, two million people use TransferWise to transfer more than £1.5 billion ($2.12 billion) every month, saving themselves more than £2 million ($2.9 million) every day. 
 
“A more competitive, innovative and safer future - where even non-bank PSPs have the freedom to offer truly independent, tailored payment propositions - is within our grasp,” said Craig Tillotson, CEO, Faster Payments.
