The deal prohibited the Los Angeles woman from disclosing the alleged relationship with Broidy, the paper said. The woman chose to terminate the pregnancy, Broidy said in a statement supplied to the Journal.

        The Broidy agreement used the pseudonyms David Dennison and Peggy Peterson, the paper reported. Those were the same pseudonyms used in the agreement that Cohen arranged for Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. That deal, which Trump didnâ€™t sign, is the subject of a continuing arbitration and court battle.Broidy and Cohen serve as deputy fundraising chairs for the Republican National Committee.
