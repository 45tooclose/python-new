            Center-right leaders staged a show of unity in a second round of talks with Italy’s president, claiming the right for Matteo Salvini’s euroskeptic League to indicate a premier as a deadlock in the search for a new government persisted.Ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi, Salvini’s junior partner in the center-right alliance, introduced him as “our leader” to reporters after Sergio Mattarella, the head of state, received them with Giorgia Meloni of the far-right Brothers of Italy. The three leaders had met Mattarella separately in a first round of talks last week.Salvini said the center-right was ready to “form a strong and lasting government with a premier indicated by the League.” He said its priorities were tax cuts, jobs for young people, pension reform, fighting poverty and “firm opposition to clandestine immigration.”

        In a thinly-veiled attack on the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which has offered to govern with the League but not with Berlusconi, Salvini denounced “a game of political tactics, of refusals, and of vetoes while Italians suffer and await solutions.”
