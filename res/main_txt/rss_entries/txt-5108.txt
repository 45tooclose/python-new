      BREAKING DOWN 'Banks For Cooperatives'
      Banks for cooperatives are part of the Federal Farm Credit System and are subject to regulation by the Farm Credit Administration. The Farm Credit System provides short-, intermediate-, and long-term loans for agricultural purposes. The Federal Farm Credit System is a nationwide cooperative system of banks and associations providing credit to farmers, agricultural concerns and related businesses. The Farm Credit System provides more than $304 billion in loans, leases, and related services to farmers, ranchers, rural homeowners, aquatic producers, timber harvesters, agribusinesses, and agricultural and rural utility cooperatives. This amounts to about one-third of the credit needed by those who live and work in rural America. The agency is capitalized by the issuance of bonds whose interest is free from state and local income taxes. The loans are financed primarily by the sale of debt securities issued by the Federal Farm Credit Bank.
This cooperative system contains the Bank for Cooperatives, Farm Credit Banks and the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corp. In January 2006, the U.S. government signed a law stating that every farm credit district must have a bank for cooperatives. A bank for cooperatives will include in its title the name of the city in which it is located, or another geographical designation. When authorized by the Farm Credit Administration, each bank for cooperatives may establish such branches or other offices as appropriate for the effective operation of its business.
Banks for cooperatives are authorized to make loans and commitments and extend other technical and financial assistance, including but not limited to, collateral custody, discounting notes and other obligations, guarantees, and currency exchanges necessary to service transactions. A bank for cooperatives is also authorized to finance U.S. agricultural exports and provide international banking services for farmer-owned cooperatives.
History of Banks for Cooperatives
Banks for cooperatives were established by the Farm Credit Act of 1933, which was signed to improve access to credit for farmers. The act formally supervised the operation of the nation's federal land banks, intermediate credits banks, farm loan associations, and the central bank for cooperatives. The act was part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal to help farmers refinance mortgages over a longer time at below-market interest rates at regional and national banks. This initiative helped farmers recover from the Dust Bowl.
