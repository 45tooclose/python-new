      A weather derivative is a financial instrument used by companies or individuals to hedge against the risk of weather-related losses. The seller of a weather derivative agrees to bear the risk of losses for a premium. If no losses occur, the seller makes a profit. In the event of unexpected or adverse weather, the buyer of the derivative claims the agreed amount.

      Breaking Down 'Weather Derivative'
      Weather derivatives are typically evaluated according to an index that measures a certain aspect of weather. For example, an index might be the total rainfall over a certain period in a certain place, or the number of times the temperature falls below freezing. Companies whose business depends on the weather, such as hydro-electric companies or companies that manage sports events, might use weather derivatives as part of a risk-management strategy. Farmers might use weather derivatives to hedge against poor harvest caused by too much or too little rain, unexpected temperature swings or destructive winds.
One common index for weather derivative is known as heating degree days, or HDD. Under HDD contracts, each day the daily mean temperature falls below a predetermined reference point over a certain period of time, the amount of the departure is recorded and added to a cumulative count. The final figure determines whether the seller pays out or receives payment.
Weather derivatives developed in the 1990s to fill an unmet need in the economy. It has been estimated that roughly 20% of the U.S. economy is impacted by the weather. Agriculture, energy, travel and construction are examples of industries in which weather plays an especially important role. But unexpected weather rarely results in price adjustments that fully makes up for lost revenue. Weather derivatives allow companies to hedge against the possibility of weather that might adversely affect their business.
In 1997, weather derivatives began trading over-the-counter, and within a few years they had become an $8 billion industry. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange lists weather derivative contracts for a few dozen cities, the majority of them in the U.S. Some hedge funds treat weather derivatives as an investment class, and some investors are drawn to weather derivatives due to their low correlation with traditional markets. 
Weather Derivatives Compared to Insurance
Weather derivatives are similar to but different from insurance. Insurance is bought for low-probability, catastrophic weather events like hurricanes and tornados. In contrast, derivatives cover higher-probability events like a dryer-than-expected summer. Insurance does not protect against the reduced demand resulting from a slightly wetter summer than average, for example, but weather derivatives can do just that. Since weather derivatives and insurance cover two different possibilities, a company might have an interest in purchasing both.
In addition, since the contract is index-based, buyers of weather derivatives do not need to demonstrate loss. In order to collect insurance, on the other hand, loss must be demonstrated.
