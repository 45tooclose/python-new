After the corporate merger, Dolan was made the Middle East and Africa regional director of Exxon Mobil Chemical Company. He later worked as executive vice president of Exxon Mobil Saudi Arabia, and vice president of Exxon Mobil, prior to assuming the position of senior vice president. Dolan earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and an MBA degree at Drexel University.

Rex Tillerson
Rex Tillerson, who first came to work at Exxon in 1975 as a production engineer, assumed the positions of chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) in 2006. Tillerson has a long and distinguished history at the company. In 1989, he was appointed the general manager of the central production division of Exxon Company U.S.A., overseeing oil and gas production in the critical areas of Texas and Oklahoma. His work earned him the position of production advisor at Exxon in 1992. He next took an overseas position as the president of Exxon Yemen Inc. In 1998, he moved on to become the president of Exxon Neftegas Ltd. and vice president of Exxon Ventures Inc., where he managed Exxon's affairs in Russia. Prior to assuming his current position at the company, Tillerson also served as executive vice president of Exxon Mobil Development Company, senior vice president of Exxon Mobil and president of Exxon Mobil.
Tillerson was selected by then-President Elect Donald Trump to serve as his Secretary of State, and was given a $180 million retirement package. Tillerson sold all of his stock in the company, with stock that he would've made in future years liquidated and the value put in a trust unable to invest in Exxon. Tillerson is no longer a shareholder, but his influence over the company and the country have been massive. On March 13th of 2018, Tillerson was fired from the White House by President Trump.
