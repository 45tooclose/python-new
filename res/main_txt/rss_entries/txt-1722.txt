Aziz Abdel-Qader  |  Regulation ( Institutional FX )  |   Friday, 20/04/2018 | 09:06 GMT   Photo: iStockShare this articleThe Financial Stability Board (FSB) has developed a toolkit that firms and ‎supervisors can use to reduce misconduct risk and address its ‎widespread incidents. ‎The new toolkit strengthens governance of misconduct risks in financial ‎institutions and covers information gaps about individuals with a history of ‎misconduct. It also addresses the use of governance mechanisms to mitigate ‎cultural risk factors that drive misconduct.‎The international body, which monitors and makes recommendations about the global ‎financial system, has launched its work plan to develop measures to reduce ‎misconduct risk back in 2015.‎The initiative follows on the heels of a series of high-profile misconduct cases that ‎came to light in recent years. The FSB identified several areas for further investigation ‎with aim to prepare a toolkit for supervisors and financial undertakings on these areas.‎‏ ‏The toolkit provides a set of options based on the shared experience and ‎diversity of perspective of FSB members in dealing with misconduct issues.‎The FSB statement further reads: ‎The toolkit completes an important element of the FSB’s efforts to promote ‎incentives for good behaviour through:‎standards and codes of behaviour, such as the FX Global Code, and ‎reforms to benchmark-setting practices;‎the toolkit of measures to address misconduct in wholesale ‎markets developed by the International Organization of Securities ‎Commissions, based on national approaches; andFSB’s guidance on the use of compensation tools to promote good ‎conduct, which will be followed up by recommendations on national data ‎collection on compensation and conduct.‎  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: FSBRelated News Cboe Market Data and Analytics Now Available Through DataShop APIs  Beeks Financial Cloud Breaks into Equities, Connects to IEX Exchange  FSB Warns Public Against Clement Maloi, Posing as Director at the Group  Got a news tip?
