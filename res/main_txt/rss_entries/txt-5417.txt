Monex Group Announces Changes to Monthly Reporting Procedures Monex and TradeStation will now be responsible for providing monthly reports    David Kimberley  |  Exchanges ( Institutional FX )  |   Monday, 07/05/2018 | 12:56 GMT   Photo: Japanese FlagShare this articleMonex Group, Inc. announced on Monday that it will be making changes to the way two of its subsidiaries report their monthly metrics. The two subsidiaries, Monex, Inc., a securities trading company, and TradeStation Group Inc., a trading technology firm, will now report their monthly reports directly.Previously, Monex Group would provide monthly reports for both companies themselves. The Japanese financial services company has traditionally automated this process through the use of the third-party, TDnet System.Now both companies will be responsible for disclosing their own financial reports through their own respective websites. The two subsidiaries will start the new disclosure process with their reports for April 2018. They will also disclose all previous data that has already been reported by Monex Group.Different places, different release timesReports will be made available to the public on the 3rd of each month. The company noted that exact release times may differ given that Monex is based in Japan and TradeStation has its headquarters in the United States.Monex Group will likely continue to provide a cumulative report each month, detailing its total revenues across the companies it owns and operates. The company did not explain why it sought to make a change to two of its largest subsidiaries’ reporting procedures.The Japanese firm’s own disclosure policy appears to advocate for clarity and transparency for both retail and institutional investors. Whether or not this change in reporting procedures will aid in their efforts to meet those standards remains to be seen. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: monex / monex-group / tradestationRelated News Intercontinental Exchange’s FX Volumes Down 27% in April 2018  Central Counterparties Fail to Live Up to PFMI Expectations  Monex Group Generates Record Revenues in March 2018  Got a news tip?
