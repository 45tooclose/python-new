Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase acquired mobile ethereum wallet Cipher Browser Friday, the startup announced on Twitter.
Cipher Browser, which also offers a Web 3 decentralized app (Dapp) browser, announced the move Friday afternoon, saying the startup would further merge many of its features with Toshi, the decentralized mobile browser launched by Coinbase.
Further, Cipher browser founder Peter Kim will become the new head of engineering at Toshi as the two apps integrate their features, according to the announcement.
"We'll be merging many features of Cipher into Toshi.Â We're committed to building the best Web 3 experience on mobile," Cipher Browser's tweet continued. 

In a later tweet, Cipher Browser announced that testnets would become one of the first features introduced to Toshi after the merger is completed.
In a tweet, Toshi said its team was "excited to combine forces and build the best browser for the decentralized web!"
As a joke, Cipher Browser later asked "When moon?" while referencing Dapps, ethereum and Web 3.
