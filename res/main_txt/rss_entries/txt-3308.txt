      BREAKING DOWN 'Italian Derivatives Market - IDEM'
      The Borsa Italiana exchange dates back to the early 1800s when it was created to replace the former Borsa di Comercio. The Italian Derivatives Market (IDEM) was launched in 1994 by the Italian government. In 2000 the IDEM, along with the Italian Stock Exchange board, was privatized by the Italian government. The government-controlled Stock Exchange Board handed control of IDEM and the Italian Stock Exchange on to the Borsa Italiana, which is held privately by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSE). The Borsa Italiana is responsible for management of the IDEM and the Italian Stock Exchange.
The Italian Derivatives Market (IDEM) is cleared by the Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia (CC&G), which is also part of the London Stock Exchange Group. The IDEM trades approximately 200,000 contracts daily, which places it in the top derivatives exchanges, by volume, in Europe. The IDEM trades derivatives, specifically options and futures.
