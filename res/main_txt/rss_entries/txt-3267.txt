        “My only hope is that this election period in Turkey doesn’t lead to more polarization and division,” Gul said, as he criticized fellow AK Party members for speaking against him amid rumors of his candidacy. Gul said that economic concerns in the country have reached “serious levels,” and that politics have been taken hostage by insults and rhetoric.
