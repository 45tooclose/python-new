      BREAKING DOWN 'ISO 9000'
      ISO 9000 standards were developed to help manufacturers effectively document the quality system elements that need to be implemented to maintain an efficient quality system. They are increasingly being applied to any organization or industry. ISO 9001 is now being used as a basis for quality management, in the service sector, education and in government, because it can help organizations satisfy their customers, meet regulatory requirements and achieve continual improvement.
The ISO 9000 series, or family of standards, was originally published in 1987, by the International Organization for Standardization. They first gained popularity in Europe, and then spread to the U.S. in the 1990s. As the world’s view of quality assurance has evolved, these standards have been revised, in 2000 and 2008. Today quality management is understood to be about processes that need to be properly managed, both technically and in terms of human resources. Current versions of ISO 9000 and ISO 9001 were published in September 2015.
Individuals and organizations cannot be certified to ISO 9000 – it simply lays out the fundamentals and vocabulary of quality management systems. ISO 9001 is the only standard within the ISO 9000 family to which organizations can certify, which is a process that takes over a year and requires substantial documentation to demonstrate conformity.
The ISO 9000 family contains these standards:
ISO 9001:2015: Quality management systems — Requirements
ISO 9000:2015: Quality management systems — Fundamentals and vocabulary (definitions)
ISO 9004:2009: Quality management systems — Managing for the sustained success of an organization (continuous improvement)
ISO 19011:2011: Guidelines for auditing management systems
