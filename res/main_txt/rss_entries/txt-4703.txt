      A cash commodity is a tangible product to be delivered in exchange for payment. A contract for a cash commodity will specify the exact amount of that commodity that is expected to be delivered, along with the date of the delivery and the price. Cash commodities are also sometimes referred to as actuals. Cash commodities can include agricultural products, minerals, oil, gold and treasury bonds.  
It is important that contracts make clear whether a cash commodity is expected at the end of a contract or not. This is because some commodities and futures contracts are cash-settled, which means that no physical goods actually trade hands through  the contract.
In cash-settled contracts, cash changes hands, rather than the actual physical commodities being traded. A contract would be cash-settled if the purchaser of the commodities was a speculator who was not actually interested in purchasing the physical commodities. They may only be interested in capitalizing on the commodity’s rise in price. A speculator may buy a shipment of corn at a low price, for example, and then sell it at a profit when the price of corn goes up. However, through a broker, it is possible for this investor to never actually have physical possession of this shipment of corn.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Cash Commodity'
      A cash commodity is a tangible commodity that a person or company has use for. Companies enter into contracts for a cash commodities because they are betting on, or hedging, that they have secured a good price for a commodity that they need. For example, a large sausage manufacturer may anticipate the price of pigs going up over the next six months. In order to lock in a good price on pigs, they can execute a futures contract. The sausage company agrees to buy a certain number of pigs for a set price at a predetermined date. This date may be, for example, three months in the future. At that date, the company will receive a delivery of pigs in exchange for their payment. The company was not speculating, because they were counting on an actual delivery of pigs.
Speculating rather than hedging
However, a speculator may purchase that same lot of pigs for the same price at the same time through a futures contract. But in the case of the speculator, that person does not actually want ten truckloads of pigs delivered to their door. They are only trying to profit off of the change in prices that they anticipate in the price of pigs. Thus, this futures contract would be cash-settled, as opposed to settled through a cash commodity.
