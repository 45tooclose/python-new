This weekend has seen some potentially good news for crypto regulation. In India, a crypto company has filed a claim against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for their earlier decision to end dealings with crypto-related entities, claiming the ban is unconstitutional. RBI has until May 24 to respond to a notice, then reportedly issued by the High Court of Delhi.
