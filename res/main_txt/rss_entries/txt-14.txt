The Foundation reported that in 2017 alone, more than 2.9 billion identity records were leaked or otherwise compromised throughout myriad security incidences.A statement from the Foundation read that “these damaging and costly security breaches are a consequence of the internet being developed without a true identity layer.” Sovrin is aiming to address this “infrastructure flaw” by adding “the missing identity layer to the internet.”The Sovrin network is already operating in a limited capacity; wider access to the network is expected to arrive on the scene mid-year.The network is based on digitally-signed credential standards that are being developed by the World Wide Web Consortium. It will use cryptographically signed credentials to verify each owners’ information.The initiative has already enlisted the efforts of other international IT firms, including Deutsche Telekom’s ‘Telekom Innovation Laboratories’, the company’s innovation and research unit.IBM is Bullish on BlockchainIBM’s announcement that it will be contributing resources to the Sovrin Foundation is only the latest in a series of blockchain-related initiatives that the company has gotten involved in. Most recently, IBM launched the “IBM Blockchain Platform Starter Plan,” which it described as “an inaugural, low-cost plan for clients, developers, and startups to quickly develop, operate, and govern networks on the IBM Blockchain Platform.”“By applying blockchain to transform core processes, new ecosystems and networks are forming,” a blog post announcing the Blockchain Platform said. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: blockchain / blockchain companies / crypto / IbmRelated News Exclusive: Facebook to Launch its Own Cryptocurrency with Massive ICO  Mayor of Seoul Announces City Cryptocurrency  First Soros Invests in Cryptocurrency and Now Rockefeller – Is Buffett Next?
