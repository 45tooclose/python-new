      An Asian bond fund is a fund that invests in government and corporate debt of Asian countries. These funds often exclude Japan, as it is not an emerging economy and therefore is a much different investing landscape than other Asian nations.
There are two types of Asian bond funds: dollar-denominated, or hard-money, Asian bond funds, and local-currency denominated Asian bond funds. For investors worried about taking on the risk of investing in the domestic currencies of emerging economies on the Asian continent, a dollar-denominated fund may make sense. At the same time, investing in the local currency of a fast-growing, emerging economy can provide added gains.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Asian Bond Fund - ABF'
      Asian bond funds are typically benchmarked to an index of Asian debt securities, like the JP Morgan Asia Credit Index or the the Markit iBoxx Asian USD Bond Index, with J.P. Morgan emerging markets debt indices being the most loyally followed by asset managers in the industry.
Asian bond funds, and emerging market debt in general, grew in popularity during the 2000s, as corporate and government borrowers showed they had learned their lessons from the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s, and as bond investors searched for higher yields. Except for during the immediate aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, investors have stayed loyal to these types of investments, as low interest rates in the developed world make their higher yields attractive.
Corporations and governments in Asia have also benefited from the popularity of Asian bond funds. Traditionally, it was very difficult for governments and companies in emerging markets like Thailand or Indonesia to attract investor interest in debt that was denominated in local currencies, as bond buyers didn’t want to accept risks associated with unproven economies. It was this dynamic, in fact, that exacerbated the 1997 Asian financial crisis, as local businesses that borrowed in dollars couldn’t not pay back dollar loans with their collapsing local currencies.
Many emerging-market central banks responded by amassing large foreign-exchange reserves to prevent against a currency crisis, and to insure that local businesses and financial institutions can buy dollars with local currency at reasonable price. This helped ease investor concerns about investing in local-currency funds, and now each year there is much greater issuance of local currency debt than hard currency debt.
