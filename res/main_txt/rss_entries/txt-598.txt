            President Donald Trump said that Special Counsel Robert Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein have conflicts of interest and called the investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election “corrupt” in his latest attack on the probe.“Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake & Corrupt Russia Investigation, headed up by the all Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama,” Trump said in a tweet about two hours after taunting the Kremlin on Twitter about a planned U.S. attack on Syria.“Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA & Comey letter). No Collusion, so they go crazy!”
