Given everything the platform has to offer, it’s rather obvious that the coin’s current price is incredibly undervalued. Here are 6 reasons why.Waves-NG is the Fastest Blockchain in the WorldIt may only be 38th on CoinMarketCap.com, but Waves is #1 when it comes to blockchain transaction speed — thanks to its implementation a ground-breaking new protocol which will allow its blockchain to process thousands of transactions per minute. This not only means that Waves is the fastest blockchain in the world, but also that it plans on staying that way.Additionally, Waves-NG – a next-generation consensus algorithm based on Cornell Computer Science academics Emin Gün Sirer’s and Ittay Eyal’s Bitcoin-NG proposal – makes the platform even easier and faster. Waves-NG is the first blockchain to adapt the Bitcoin-NG proposal, which was designed to address Bitcoin’s scalability issues by turning it into a proof-of-stake consensus.Waves Wallet is Multifunctional, Simple, and SecureWith Waves’, you — and only you — control your funds. This is ensured by the fact that users’ funds are stored in blockchain addresses that only they control. Users are also able to create a multi-currency wallet, receive interest on their Waves account balances, transfer funds to other users, and mine cryptocurrencies with ease.Waves Offers a Decentralized Exchange (DEX)The cryptocurrency market has already begun its move to decentralized exchanges, and Waves is well ahead of the curve — offering limitless withdrawals, immediate purchases, a matcher, high channel capacity, and off-exchange wallets.Fees are also kept to a minimum, with only a small fixed commission on a per-order basis.Anyone Can Issue TokensOne thing that many investors don’t know about Waves is that the platform affords individuals the ability to make their own internal digital currency, while also using the blockchain for crowdfunding. Users may also use the blockchain to pay for goods and services, or for the creation of voting systems and loyalty/rewards programs.Thus far, a rough total of 11,489 tokens have been released on Waves, with a total market capitalization of more than $1 billion.WavesGo Makes Launching a New Gateway SimpleIn essence, WavesGo provides a framework that removes the complexity from launching a new gateway. This allows coin teams to incorporate their project with Waves and grant their community the ability to trade it on Waves’ decentralized exchange, DEX.As Bitcoinist previously reported, The WavesGo framework takes care of all the work that comes with integrating blockchain elements that are common for all coins. Only the unique aspects of a particular cryptocurrency need to be supplied by developers — specifically, the interface to their protocol. For example, only an estimated 100 lines of code were needed to integrate Litecoin (LTC) — the rest was provided by the gateway framework.Waves is Launching Smart ContractsFinally, and perhaps most importantly, Waves has launched support for smart contracts, which will provide a plethora of new additions and added benefits to the platform’s ecosystem. Some of these benefits include:Support for multi-signature wallets, which cannot be controlled by simply one person alone.No gas for non-Turing complete smart-contracts.Comparable service to Ethereum, but both easier and cheaper to use.The ability to immediately distribute and trade created tokens on DEX.Support for atomic swaps in the future.Support for token freezes.Support for decentralized applications (DApps).To learn more about smart contracts on Waves, check out Bitcoinist’s previous report here.Do you think Waves is currently undervalued?
