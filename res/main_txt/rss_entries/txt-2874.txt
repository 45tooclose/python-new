      Money on the sidelines is cash that is held either in savings or in low-risk, low-yield investment vehicles, such as certificates of deposits (CDs), instead of being placed in investments that have the potential for greater rewards, such as the stock or bond markets. Money on the sidelines avoids risk, especially during periods of economic or market uncertainty.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Money on the Sidelines'
      Money on the sidelines describes the amount of money held in cash or lower-risk investments while individuals and companies wait for economic conditions to improve. Legendary investor Warren Buffett is known to take advantage of times when most investors are on the sidelines, opening or adding to positions in undervalued companies at bargain prices. Buffet has said of his investment strategy, "Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.”
Money on the sidelines examples
Equity market sectors and Treasury bonds moving to the downside with increased volume is an example of a market selloff. Money is not moving from one sector to another and is not moving from stocks to bonds or vice versa. The money is being removed to the sidelines. This can be a safe way to ride out a downturn, even if the move to the sidelines caused that downturn. Once the market has stabilized and starts to move higher, there could be significant amounts of money pressuring specific sectors or the entire market to the upside as this money is reinvested.
However, buying stocks does not extinguish cash assets. The money transfers from the buyer to the seller and then sits on the sidelines. So, the relative amount of money held in cash must be considered. Cash frequently changing of hands and active stock buying eventually would bid up the stock market. As stock prices move up and cash prices stay the same, the cash becomes a smaller part of the asset allocation mix of households and companies. A way to measure this relative dynamic is to calculate the total market value of the S&P 500 and compare it to the total value of money market funds. Another way is to estimate the amount of available cash in individual’s brokerage accounts. Also, margin debt, or borrowed money to buy stocks, can be employed. Buying stocks with debt works if prices keep rising, but if investors must borrow record amounts to sustain a rally, that does not support the money on the sidelines theory. Money market holdings can continue to change hands to support higher stock prices until the fundamental drivers of the rally run out. As long as interest rates do not rise, earnings continue to grow and there are no signs of a recession, stock prices and investment may continue to increase. But this is not a result of money on the sidelines.
