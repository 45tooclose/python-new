            339 Days to GoToday in Brexit: Leave supporters are dialing back their rhetoric on the customs union as the campaign to force Prime Minister Theresa May to stay in gains momentum.Pressure is mounting on Theresa May to stay in the European Union’s trading bloc in a U-turn that would enrage Brexit enthusiasts. But the Brexit backers in her Cabinet are hardly lining up to threaten resignation if she goes ahead.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson dodged the question on Monday when asked if he would resign if Parliament forces May to stay in the customs union, reiterating his view that Brexit means leaving the trading regime too. Meanwhile Trade Secretary Liam Fox, whose main job is to make the independent trade policy that would be impossible inside the customs union, made a good case for why staying in wouldn’t be such an obstacle to a new “global Britain.”#lazy-img-326927185:before{padding-top:66.60000000000001%;}Boris JohnsonPhotographer: Chris J.

        The House of Lords has voted in favor of the customs union – an arrangement that businesses, the opposition Labour Party and many Conservatives want to maintain as it helps cross-border trade – and the House of Commons is expected to vote to keep it in a debate as soon as next month. The Cabinet is divided, but May’s inner circle thinks she could be forced to concede because of the parliamentary arithmetic. While such a move would be risky at home, it would help reboot talks in Brussels.Fox, a veteran Brexit supporter, hinted that given the U.K.’s strength lies in the service industries that make up 80 percent of the economy, the rules governing manufacturing goods such as cars are less important. The customs union only deals with goods, and some Brexit-watchers say that the government could justify a U-turn by saying it can still go out in the world to sign deals on services and the industries of the future.“The point that I am making, though, is that discussions around trade and export policy can often be too focused on the movement of physical goods, to the detriment of our comparative advantage in services,” Fox told a conference in London.

        Fox argues that free-trade agreements have done little for the service industries that are key to Britain. “While the system has many strengths, its provisions remain under-equipped to effectively govern the global trade in services,” he said on Monday. “It would be remiss for developed nations such as ours not to recognize this potential and lead the way on trade in services liberalization.”He went on to say: “Often, there is broad agreement between nations on the need to liberalize this trade. As a result, barriers can often be removed more swiftly and easily when compared to traditional FTAs.”

        There seems to be a growing sense that FTAs aren’t all they are cracked up to be. And signing new FTAs with non-EU countries was the main point of leaving the customs union. Tim Ross reported earlier this month that some of May’s officials think that trade deals with third countries can take a long time to negotiate and end up mired in litigation, while measures short of formal FTAs can still deliver significant benefits.All eyes will be on Brexit Secretary David Davis at Parliament’s Brexit Committee tomorrow for signs he’s trying to justify a U-turn before it happens.Today’s Must-ReadsGermany  wants to help the U.K. get access for its banks to the European market but can only help if the U.K. makes some concessions, Birgit Jennen reports.

History has always shown that when we stay together we can sort out problems. When we split then we start fighting. There was not one time in history where division creates success,” he told the Guardian. (The city of Liverpool voted to remain in the referendum.)#lazy-img-326927146:before{padding-top:63.72%;}Jurgen KloppPhotographer: Alex Livesey/Getty Images EuropeSomething to add? Please join our Facebook group, Brexit Decoded, and follow us @Brexit on Twitter.Missed yesterday’s Bulletin?You can catch up here, or sign up to get it as a daily newsletter.
