            The Treasury Department is considering using an emergency law to curb Chinese investments in sensitive technologies in the U.S., said Heath Tarbert, an assistant secretary in Treasury’s international affairs office.The investment curbs would be the latest step in President Donald Trump’s plan to punish China for what the U.S. sees as violations of American intellectual-property rights. The president asked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to consider investment restrictions on Chinese firms after the administration released the results of its probe into China’s IP practices last month.Tarbert, speaking Thursday at an event in Washington, also said Treasury is currently pushing for legislation in Congress that would expand its authority to review foreign investment in the U.S.
