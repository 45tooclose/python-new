Despite the theft and loss, Coincheck is one of the largest crypto exchanges in Japan and will definitely boost the plans of its parent firm to enter into the new sector. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: blockchain / Coincheck / ICO / Japan / monex / monex-groupRelated News NEO Blockchain’s First Decentralized Exchange Goes Live  IOTA to Demonstrate IoT Applications at Industry Conference in Germany Tomorrow  How Blockchain Technology Makes You a Hedge Fund Investor  Got a news tip?
