Bitcoin (BTC) surged 14 percent this morning after a month of steady decline, with a $1,000 dollar spike over the course of 45 minutes, drawing the overall cryptocurrency market over $300M. 
After two weeks of lateral trading, Bitcoin (BTC) leapt nearly $1,100 the morning of Thursday, Apr. 12 -- jumping from yesterday's high $6,939 to $8,055, according to Coindesk -- marking the first time the price has eclipsed the $8,000 mark since March.

The price has largely consolidated since the bull run, with BTC currently trading at $7,856.88. This follows reports from late March citing a possible market uptick.  
Of special note is that this is purportedly the biggest one-hour candle volume Bitcoin has ever witnessed.
