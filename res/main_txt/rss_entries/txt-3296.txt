The prior year in crypto has seen BTC go from under $1,000 to almost $20,000 and correct back to under $10,000. Today I am proud to announce a fork of ZCL and BTC.An Interesting Forking Project It may be difficult at times to hold back the excitement but to ensure a fair report of the project I will try to withhold my very enthusiastic nature regarding the project. One of the main reasons is when has CNBC ever decided to cover a Forking Announcement (very punny I know)?A fork (soft or hard) has become a fairly common occurrence in the crypto space. The question arises which ones are real and which are scam related. Premined forked coins are always ones to be concerned with along with teams that chose to remain anonymous. Anonymous Bitcoin intends to achieve a fork of ZCL and BTC completely transparently to the public, with weekly video updates and communication with the community.The project is titled Anonymous Bitcoin, and the Anonymous Bitcoin team intends to succeed where prior forks have failed while also adding unique technology to already tried and true blockchains. The co-fork will occur using BTC and ZCL, so in order to obtain the new forked coin, Anonymous Bitcoin, one would have to purchase either BTC or ZCL before the date of fork snapshot.The Anonymous Bitcoin testnet will go live August 10, providing a month for exchanges to test the wallets and infrastructure before the snapshot occurs on September 9, 2018. The mainnet will be live within 48 hours of snapshot allowing for swift integration onto exchange platforms. Exchange listing and targeting ones with significant volume are one of the most important features of a new coin beyond utility and technology.The main features of Anonymous Bitcoin will include anonymity while transacting (using zkSNARKs technology), increased transaction speed (through increased block sizes), and the ability to stake coins through masternodes. This trifecta of technological upgrades will create a cryptocurrency in Bitcoin’s image, with staking abilities and anonymity upgrades.The Anonymous Bitcoin Team is broken into multiple layers. The BTCA team is composed of the core development team, founders, advisors, social media gurus, blockchain journalists, and even crypto compliance attorneys. The core development team is led by the founders of Miami-based Bushido Lab. The most notable advisor, Steven Nerayoff, has worked on projects such as Ethereum, Lisk, tZERO, ZClassic, AION, and many more. Having advisors of this caliber is essential – especially for a forked coin – to ensure market adoption.Blockchain journalists and Fintech analysts have come on as advisors to ensure the progression within the space and to provide inside news coverage regarding the entire forking process. A production team has been assembled to provide weekly video updates about what the team has been up to regarding conferences, networking, and ‘work’ for the week. This will allow transparency literally from within. The crypto compliance attorneys are solely there to ensure we remain compliant with the ever-changing regulatory structure of cryptocurrencies. A fork is not considered a securities offering as no tokens are being sold but it always helps to have attorneys making sure compliance is maintained on all fronts.With a roadmap that has already been structured and deadlines that will not be missed Anonymous Bitcoin is ready to begin their journey from concept to a forking cryptocurrency.Please visit the project website Anonymousbitcoin.io – which will go live on Sunday – for further details or get in contact with the team directly:    Twitter: @BTCA_FORK    Discord: https://discord.gg/xJWCGB9    Reddit: AnonymousBitcoinTo get in contact directly with the Crypto King, you can on Twitter (@JbtheCryptoKing) or Reddit (ICO updates and Daily Reports).What are your thoughts on the upcoming fork and creation of Anonymous Bitcoin?
