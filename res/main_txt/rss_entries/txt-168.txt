Expanding the number and types of buyers of Bitcoin and digital currencies will be critical to their long-term use and therefore price. Finder.com surveyed 2,001 American adults to help determine who had been buying cryptocurrencies, and found that just under 8% own them. I don’t think this is too surprising given their newness and risk. In its survey it found that  men were more than twice as likely to own a digital currency than women, and that  the largest reason for not owning one was a perception that they didn’t need to. Bitcoin was the runaway “winner” with 5.15% of people owning it followed by Ethereum at 1.8% and then Bitcoin Cash at 0.9%. 
[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]

Finder.com found that Millennials (about ages between 22 and 37) had a 17% ownership rate, Gen X (about 37 to 55) were at a bit less than 9% and Baby Boomers were just over 2%. Given the newness and technology aspect to digital currencies this is in-line with what you would expect.

Australia information adds a few data points 
The Australian Digital Commerce Association, or ADCA, and Accenture surveyed seven Australian digital currency exchanges. The results provide a few more data points about who is buying them. 
 
 
 Men were at 83%, which is a bit higher than Finder’s survey 
 The younger age skew was similar to Finder’s 
 The Exchanges, or DCE's, are starting to gain traction with investment banks and hedge funds
