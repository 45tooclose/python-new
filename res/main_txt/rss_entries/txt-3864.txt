      An investment farm is an agricultural business operation that is purchased and operated with the intention of making a profit or to create a tax deduction for the owner. Investment farms are owned by investors who typically do not live on the farm or take part in any day-to-day operations. The investor generally hires farm hands and other employees to do the actual farming.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Investment Farm'
      Many investment farms exist as commercial farming businesses that grow cash crops which can be sold in the commodities markets. These include crops such as soybeans, corn, wheat, cotton and livestock, including cattle and hogs.
Investment farm options
Farms in the United States have gotten increasingly larger on average and the number of family farms has decreased since the mid-1930s. Though investment opportunities exist, statistics compiled by the United States Department of Agriculture show that 99 percent of the farms in the country were family-run in 2015, accounting for 89 percent of the country’s agricultural production. In the same year, non-family farms only produced 11 percent of the nation’s total agricultural output. These numbers suggest that, despite the decline in the number of family farms, large-scale investment farms still must compete with large-scale family farming operations for both land and labor.
Because food is a ubiquitous need, some investors consider agricultural investments to be recession-proof. When it comes to investing in farmland, however, the increasing scale of farming operations means simply buying a farm and attempting to rent it to a farming operation can be a capital-intensive commitment, even before considering operating and equipment costs. Alternatives to the outright purchase of farmland include forming a partnership to raise additional capital or investing in a real estate investment trust, or REIT.
Farmland REITs, such as Farmland Partners and Gladstone Land Corporation, purchase agricultural land and handle the process of leasing it to farmers. Because REITS typically deal in portfolios of properties, investors purchasing shares gain several advantages over purchasing farmland themselves. First, the capital required to invest in a REIT can be as low as the price of a single share. This spreads the capital at risk in any given farming operation across multiple investors, reducing the risk to any single shareholder. Second, the presence of multiple farms in a portfolio offers diversification, giving investors broader exposure to the production of different commodities. This diversification serves to offset some of the riskier elements involved in owning a single farm. Finally, shares in a REIT usually trade on stock exchanges, making them significantly easier to buy and sell than agricultural real estate.
