"Big 4" consulting firm Deloitte has a new blockchain lead.
Following the departure of Eric Piscini from the role, Linda Pawczuk, who formerly ran the company's insurance sector blockchain projects, will be stepping in as the new head of the Deloitte U.S. Financial Services Industry Blockchain group, the company announced Tuesday.
Pawczuk will work on advancing Deloitte's blockchain agenda, said spokesperson Chris Faile. To that end, Pawczuk will work at "creating new business models, disrupting existing business processes and harvesting the underlying technologies and ecosystem players to build solutions with clients and industries," he said.
"We envision that this ever-evolving and nimble team will build upon our past success in helping our clients, which includes 92 percent of the financial service companies listed on the Fortune 500 list, to hone their blockchain-backed offerings," he said. 

In future, said Faile, the firm hopes to further use blockchain technology as a "railroad track" to other emerging technologies, such as cloud computing and automation.
The company's former blockchain lead, Piscini, is leaving the firm to join a startup project, Faile said. The company sees his move "as a testament to Deloitte's successful efforts" in helping its team gain experiences and skillsets.
"When you are seen as the market leader, it's inevitable that some leaders will decide to take on new challenges outside of the organization," he said.
