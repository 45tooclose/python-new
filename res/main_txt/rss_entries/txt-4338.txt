The historical moment when leaders from South and North Korea met on April 27 and signed an agreement for peace between the two nations has now been permanently recorded on the ethereum blockchain.
According to a report from CoinDesk Korea, Ryu Gi-hyeok, a 27-year-old game developer from South Korea, has coded the Panmunjom Declaration, which includes the line "there will be no more war on the Korean peninsula," in both Korean and English and stored both versions in two ethereum transactions.
As widely reported around the world, the event saw South Korean president Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un shake hands with each other last week - the first time the countries' leaders have done so in decades - to declare an end to the Korean war.
Ryu told CoinDesk Korea: 

"I just thought it took too long for the South and the North to give way to each other ... After finding out what I could contribute to this historic achievement as a developer, I found the Panmunjom Declaration on the Blue House homepage and recorded it on ethereum."
Inspired by activists of the #metoo moment in China, who used the ethereum blockchain to record messages as a way to evade internet censorship, Ryu said he is also planning to launch a website service that will "keep all historic records permanent and immutable" on a blockchain.
As reported by CoinDesk, in the earlier case, an open letter written by a senior student from China's prestigious Peking University about a historical case of alleged rape was initially censored across the internet in China. However, it was later converted to code and stored on the ethereum blockchain by an anonymous individual.
The move subsequently sparked interest across members from different universities in China, who subsequently voiced their support for the letter's writer using the blockchain.
