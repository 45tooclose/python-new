Most of us have at some point or other. After all, owning an online casino must be like owning a money printing machine.There are two schools of thought here – on the one hand, are those that believe that owning an online casino must be super easy. After all, from the surface, it looks like the online casino runs itself. The entire thing is run by a computer, all the games and everything else. So all you have to do is have the right amount of money to start the casino, right?The other school of thought believes that owning and operating an online casino must be a near-gargantuan task. They don’t see the simple fact that everything works off software as a factor that mitigates the complexity or difficulty of the operation. In this camp, the very idea of an ordinary person owning and operating an online casino is next to impossible. It would simply require too much money and there would be too many things to consider that only someone on the inside (or well connected) would know how to pull off.So, which is it, is it is easy or is it really difficult to open an online casino? Of the two schools of thought outlined above, which is the most accurate? What if there was a third option that allowed you to skip both of these schools of thought altogether?A New Way of Playing Online Casino GamesThere is an entirely new way of playing online casino games that is causing quite a stir within the online gambling community. This new way of playing is such a bold step that many experienced online gamblers and industry experts are calling it a revolution in online gambling.It’s called ZeroEdge and it will totally change the way you think about online gambling for good.Up until now, all online casinos have been operating on the same principle called the house edge. The house edge is an unfair advantage that is built into every single online casino game and it gives the house (the casino) a consistent advantage over the player, regardless of the actual outcome of the wager. For many gamblers, this is simply unacceptable and, as a result, has caused many to close their online casino accounts in search of something better.ZeroEdge is that something better for two very important reasons. One, ZeroEdge has removed all house edge advantage percentages in their casino games. In other words, all ZeroEdge slots, roulette, blackjack and other games, feature a true 0% house edge. For the first time ever, online casino games are actually fair. Two, ZeroEdge does not use conventional currencies to run its online casino. Instead, ZeroEdge has created its own cryptocurrency called Zerocoin, and it is the only way one can play their games.Since this is an entirely new way of building and running an online casino, ZeroEdge is giving anyone who wants to own and operate their own online casino the opportunity to do so and earn Zerocoin based on the demand for zero edge casino games. All you have to do is visit the ZeroEdge website and fill in the ZeroEdge white label online casino application form to begin the process.
