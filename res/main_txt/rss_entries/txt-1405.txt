Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase hired a new chief financial officer.
Alesia Haas, the former CFO at Oz Management and OneWest Bank, will take on the role at Coinbase effective immediately, the company said in a blog post on Tuesday. At the same time, Haas is set to assist Oz with the transition through June 1.
Coinbase's president and chief operating officer, Asiff Hirji, said that Haas "will allow us to accelerate our goal of building a world-class financial team that scales with the company through this period of profound growth," adding that she has "extensive experience in managing highly regulated complex financial institutions."
"I'm incredibly excited to have Alesia join Coinbase as our new CFO. She brings deep financial services experience to our growing company. As a fintech company, finance is core to everything that we do," Brian Armstrong, Coinbase's co-founder and CEO, said in a statement. 

Haas' hiring represents the latest talent grab for Coinbase, which has been on a bit of a hiring spree in recent months.
Earlier this month, Coinbase hiring former Facebook and Twitter communications lead Rachael Horwitz as its new communications vice president. In March, Coinbase tapped former New York Stock Exchange executive Eric Scro as its new finance vice president and former LinkedIn executive Emilie Choi as vice president of corporate and business development.
Coinbase has also grown its ranks through the acquisitions of bitcoin startup Earn.com and ethereum wallet Cipher Browser.
