      A commodity block currency is any currency that correlates strongly with the price of a specific commodity. Commodity block currencies are created when a large proportion of a country’s economy depends upon the production and export of a one specific commodity. As the global supply of that commodity, along with global demand, fluctuates, it affects the value of the currency of any country that relies heavily on that product’s export for revenue.
Common examples of commodities that may greatly affect a country’s currency are oil, natural gas, precious metals, and minerals.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Commodity Block Currency'
      Commodity block currencies are a sign that a country’s exports are not very diversified. A country may export a large amount of one commodity, but so long as it has other reliable sources of revenue and a variety of valuable exports, its currency should not be disproportionately affected by the price of a single commodity.
Looking at exchange rates for countries with commodity block currencies can serve as a useful tool for predicting the future prices of commodities. Commodity block currencies offer an opportunity to investors interested in commodities trading. A trader could potentially invest by taking a position in a specific commodity, for example, oil.  They could then potentially reduce their own portfolio risk by taking an opposite position on a currency that is positively correlated with the price of oil, such as the Canadian dollar.
Examples of commodity block currencies
Approximately one half of all of Russia’s export revenue comes from oil and natural gas. This causes the Russian ruble to be greatly affected by the price of oil. Thus, when the price of oil tumbled in 2014, the value of the ruble also sank significantly.
Peru’s currency, the sol, correlates with the global price of copper. Peru holds approximately 13 percent of the world’s copper reserves, and its economy depends upon copper exports. Peru also produces and exports gold, but because of the demand for copper, that commodity has a greater effect on the value of the sol. The falling rate of copper brought the sol’s value down significantly toward the end of 2015.
Other commodity block currencies include the Australian dollar, which is tied to iron ore, and the Canadian dollar and Colombian peso, which are both tied to the price of oil. In Colombia, approximately 20 percent of government revenue comes from the export of oil. Thus, the fluctuation of oil prices tends to affect that country’s economy greatly.
