            Los Angeles (AP) -- A former Playboy model who said she had an affair with President Donald Trump has settled her lawsuit with a supermarket tabloid over an agreement that prohibited her from discussing the relationship.
Karen McDougal says the settlement Wednesday with the National Enquirer's parent company "restores to me the rights to my life story."
In August 2016, American Media Inc. paid McDougal $150,000 for the rights to her story about the alleged relationship. But the story never ran.

        The suit alleged Trump's attorney, Michael Cohen, was secretly involved in her discussions with AMI.
The White House has said Trump denies the affair.
Under the agreement, McDougal can keep the $150,000 she was paid. AMI has the rights to up to $75,000 for any future profits from her story about the relationship.
