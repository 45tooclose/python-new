Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and Ripple are lumped together into the same category by some investors—the cryptocurrency assets that are ready to collapse. 
That’s according to Linda Butcher, cofounder of Rewards blockchain LTD., who sees better days returning in the cryptocurrency markets. 
There have been better days and worse days for major cryptocurrencies. The better days were back in November and December, when the major cryptocurrencies raced to new highs in a bullish rotation pattern. The worse days have been the last seven days, as they all have raced toward old lows in a bearish pattern. Bitcoin is down 19.26%, Ethereum is down 25.90%, Ripple is down 21.28% and Litecoin 26.65%--see table 1.

This crash in major cryptocurrencies comes roughly three months since the last one, and extends across the entire chain. Only seven cryptocurrencies out of the top 100 advanced in the last seven days, while 93 declined--see table 2.
