      BREAKING DOWN 'Yankee Certificate of Deposit'
      Yankee certificates of deposit are attractive to investors because they provide geographic and currency diversification as well as lower risk. However, they tend to pay low rates. Investors gain dollar income streams that they may use to pay other dollar-denominated obligations. But exchange rates can change quickly and dramatically, which can affect total return. Investors are required to apply for a bank account and make a minimum cash deposit before purchasing Yankee CDs. Yankee CDs have minimal documentation, are unsecured and not FDIC insured. The major issuers of Yankee CDs are the New York branches of the well-known international banks of Japan, Canada, England, and Western Europe, which use these funds to lend to their corporate customers in the United States. They require the issuer to pay interest on the principal amount according to the terms of the indenture. They are advantageous to foreign banks if they make borrowing cheaper than other forms of debt and enable foreign banks to invest in the U.S. market.
History of Yankee CDs
Yankee CDs were first issued in the early 1970s. Initially, they paid a higher yield than domestic CDs. Foreign banks at the time were not well known so their credit quality was difficult to assess because of different accounting rules and scant financial information. As investor perception and familiarity with foreign banks improved, the premium paid by foreign banks on their Yankee CDs declined. This cost of funds difference was partially offset by the exemption of foreign banks from Federal Reserve reserve requirements, in effect until the International Banking Act of 1978. The exemption also aided establishment of the Yankee CD market, which grew steadily in the early 1980s. In the early 1990s there was rapid growth in Yankee CDs due to the December 1990 elimination of reserve requirements on nonpersonal time deposits with maturities of less than 18 months. Previously, there was a 3 percent Federal Reserve reserve requirement for foreign banks funding dollar loans to U.S. borrowers with Yankee CDs. Foreign banks could avoid the reserve requirement by booking loans to U.S. borrowers at their offshore branches and funding the loans by issuing CDs in the euro market. But U.S. banks were prevented by Federal Reserve regulations from taking advantage of this reserve requirement loophole. As a result, borrowing in the euro market was encouraged. The December 1990 elimination of the reserve requirement erased the euro marketâ€™s cost advantage to foreign banks and encouraged these banks to issue Yankee CDs.
