Upon its release in July 2017, its price was closer to just $0.11 – a rise of around 13,000% in nine months.The best global asset YTD in 2018 is … Binance Coin $BNB @binance @cz_binance @Jack1. $BNB2. $NFLX3. $SQ4. $AMZN5. $TXWRSource: https://t.co/LovHS2AAzJ pic.twitter.com/QtADBQt0Yx— BambouClub (@BambouClub) April 24, 2018The Dark Side Of The $3 Billion MoonFor Binance itself, meanwhile, astronomic growth has come at a price which continues to unfold.This week, details of a court case against the exchange from Sequoia Capital, an early funding partner, hit the headlines.According to Bloomberg citing court filings from Hong Kong, Sequoia’s $80 million valuation of Binance in early December did not sit well with CEO Zhao Changpeng, who then consulted with other firms in a move which Sequoia considers broke the parties’ exclusivity agreement.The venture capital firm would have held an 11% stake had the December deal gone through, but other firms valued Binance considerably higher – up to $1 billion. Zhao himself values the business three times higher – $3 billion is in his view a “conservative” estimate.Sequoia since managed to secure a temporary injunction which ensured Zhao could not negotiate further with other prospective investors.
