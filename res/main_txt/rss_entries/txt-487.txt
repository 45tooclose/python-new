Seattle-based cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex is now accepting new user registrations.
New users can sign up through the exchange's revamped website, the startup announced Tuesday. Registrations were initiallyÂ paused in December due to saturated capacity and new users were enrolled through a waiting list program over the past few months, according to a statement. All customers will have to complete identity verification procedures to finish their signups.
The exchange is also launching an "enhanced website" with improved security, according to the announcement.
Bittrex CEO Bill Shihara cited the company's "responsibility to provide customers with a reliable platform and outstanding customer service" as the impetus for initially halting registrations. He added: 

"After diligently working to improve our infrastructure and upgrade our website, we're pleased to announce registration for new users resumed today."
The company noted that it had expanded its team to include former Amazon employees, as well as former members of the U.S. Departments of Justice and Homeland Security.
The move comes two months after Bittrex released its token listing criteria. The exchange's employees conduct preliminary reviews of projects, but the exchange emphasized that tokens which make it to the full review must also undergo compliance procedures to be listed within the U.S., CoinDesk reported at the time.
