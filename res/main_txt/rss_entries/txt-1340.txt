        “The thing I remember so clearly about him was that nothing was alarming about how he looked,” Daniels said. The sketch includes details of his appearance: He’s between 5 foot 9 inches and 6 feet tall, in his 30s or early 40s, and appears “lean but fit.”

        Daniels said she didn’t report the parking-lot encounter at the time because she didn’t want her husband to know about it or to think she’d put her daughter in danger.“I’m tired of being threatened,” Daniels said. “The intimidation and saying you’re going to ruin my life and take my house. I’m done being bullied.”Daniel appeared on the talk show with her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, the day after the two attended a hearing in New York about documents seized from Cohen during an FBI raid last week. Avenatti said the judge in the case recognized their right to be present because the search warrants “stemmed in significant part from what happened with my client.”For full coverage of the hearing Monday, click here.

        Avenatti said they’re offering a $100,000 reward for information that helps them identify the man. He wouldn’t say who else has seen the sketch, which is dated April 8, the day before the search of Cohen’s office, home and hotel room.
