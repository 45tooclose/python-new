Bitcoinâs ubiquity is almost sealed, as more and more entertainment shows weave the worldâs most popular cryptocurrency into plotlines. A current example is CBSâs NCIS Los Angeles, starring LL Cool J and Chris OâDonnell, where the digital asset plays a leading role. $10 million of it are stolen from a mining farm, and agents are dispatched. The episode, âOutside the Lines,â will air Sunday, 22nd April, 9pm (ET/PT). Â

LL Cool J Sets Out to Find $10 Million Worth of Stolen Bitcoin
Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) Los Angeles combines everything Americans adore: military, cops, true-ish crime, and glamor. The series, now in its 9th season, is a spinoff, focusing on a branch inside NCIS, the Office of Special Projects (OSP). Itâs an elite division with a charter for counter-terrorism. Much of the show involves undercover operations as a result.
LL Cool J
Chris OâDonnell (Special Agent G. Callen) and LL Cool J (Special Agent Sam Hanna) are the marquee names, and work together. Mr. OâDonnell, 47, is perhaps best known for his role as Dick Grayson/Robin in the mid 1990s cinematic versions of the Batman franchise. Here, heâs leader of the OSP. LL Cool J, 50, made his name as an East Coast rapper in the 1980s with songs such as âI Need Loveâ and the early 90s smash, âMama Said Knock You Out.â For the last nine years, his main role has been as a former Sea Air and Land Team (SEAL) member, and an Iraq/Afghanistan veteran, working under Mr. OâDonnellâs character.
âOutside the Lines,â episode 9.19 (the seriesâ 211th), broadcasts on Sunday, 22 April, 9pm (ET/PT) on CBS, was written by Joseph C. Wilson (JAG, NCIS). It follows characters Harley Hidoko (Andrea Bordeaux) and Sam (LL Cool J). A rather hefty theft involving a cryptocurrency mining farm of more than $10 million worth of bitcoin is the episodeâs central theme. Hidoko embraces the task, as she is new to Los Angeles, and chances are criminals would not be able to identify her. Sam, on the other hand, cannot be so sure about his identity, as heâs worked the area for years. There is a real chance any undercover operation would be compromised by him.

Every Year, More Bitcoin Recognition in Pop Culture
As good soldiers, no matter what happens, even if Sam is discovered or captured, Hidoko knows she must continue the mission: recover millions in bitcoin. Still, theyâre also taught to never leave a man behind. Thus, the probable tension. 
This, of course, isnât the first time bitcoinâs been on television. In 2016, Mr. Robot and CSI Cyber also used the idea. Last year, online service Crackle had it as a recurring theme in its show, Startup. At the end of last year, insanely popular situation comedyÂ The Big Bang TheoryÂ also featured a bitcoin theme. This year, daytime talk show queenÂ Ellen DeGeneresÂ dedicated a funny segment to it, as did John Oliver.
