 Two United States House Subcommittees will be meeting next week for a hearing on blockchain technology in supply chain management, according to a notice published on the Subcommittee on Science, Space, and Technology’s website.The Subcommittee on Oversight and the Subcommittee on Research and Technology will discuss both how blockchain could improve supply chain management as well as combating counterfeit goods.Cointelegraph reported in March on some of the Senators who came out with opinions on crypto and blockchain after the February crypto hearing held by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).Republican representative Dana Rohrabacher, who serves on the Research and Technology subcommittee, came out in positively for crypto’s use empowering citizens living in authoritarian governments, but called for more AML and KYC regulations in the crypto industry. Democratic representative Carolyn Maloney, who serves on the Oversight subcommittee, called for tighter oversight on crypto by the SEC, citing the fact that “there’s nothing backing these virtual currencies.”Last week, electronics giant Samsung said that they would look into using blockchain for their global supply chain. And yesterday, US-based life science research marketplace Scientist.com announced a blockchain platform that will validate the supply chain of research data.
