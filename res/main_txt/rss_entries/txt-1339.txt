Adult entertainment website Pornhub has announced that it will begin accepting the cryptocurrency verge as payment.
The company detailed its move in a blog post and accompanying video, saying that it will take the token for its premium services as well as other available purchases. According to Pornhub, the kick-off will be marked by events in New York City and Silicon Valley.
Pornhub VP Corey Price added in a statement:
"Not only is this an exciting announcement for us and the adult entertainment industry, it's exciting for the crypto space. History has proven that the adult entertainment industry plays a critical role in adoption for innovative technology. We saw that with VHS, Beta Max, credit card payment icons and, most recently, VR goggles. We expect to see widespread adoption of crypto and blockchain in short order." 

Verge's backers previously stoked speculation about its "mystery deal" earlier this month, and in March moved to collect donations in an effort to push ahead with the partnership.
According to Price, the partnership came about after Pornhub "approached [the Verge team] in a very deliberate selection process." He also cited the cryptocurrency's user base and a recent online push on its forums to accept the coin as payment.
"We're extremely excited to offer our fans the ability to use crypto and think Verge, with its focus on anonymity, is the best option - whether for privacy, convenience or both," Price said.
