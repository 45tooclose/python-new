“With cryptocurrencies, even when the underlying blockchain technologies are secure, there are still risks if the supporting technologies have security vulnerabilities or issues. For example, if there are security issues in cryptocurrency wallets or exchanges, these can be an avenue for an attacker to disrupt or exploit,” Steve Grobman, SVP and CTO of McAfee, one of the world's largest dedicated security companies, told me last week during the RSA Conference in San Francisco.  
As suspected, following Grobman’s warning on the vulnerability of cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, a DNS attack occurred yesterday against the popular online Ether storage solution, MyEtherWallet. Data from Chainalysis shows that the hack resulted in a loss of about 215 Ether, or roughly $152,000-worth of the cryptocurrency.

 Woke up today, put my computer on, went on to myetherwallet and saw that myetherwallet had a invalid connection certificate in the corner. I thought this was odd.  So I double checked the url address, triple checked it, went on google, got the url. Used EAL to confirm it wasn't a phishing site. And even though every part of my body told me not to try and log in, I did. As soon as I logged in, there was a countdown for about 10 seconds and a tx was made sending the available money I had on the wallet to another wallet.
