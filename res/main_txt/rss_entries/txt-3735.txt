      An authority bond, sometimes referred to as a local authority bond, is a debt security issued by an authority, such as a corporate or government agency, for purposes of financing the operations of a revenue-generating public business. Investors buy in to the authority bond for a specified period of time that allows the project to be completed and earning revenue, after which the bond will pay interest at a specified rate. Investors in authority bonds have a claim to the business's revenues, which serve as the bond's yield. Authority bonds are generally considered low-risk investments, although the risk varies.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Authority Bond'
      An authority bond is a bond issued by an authority such as a government agency or public organization or company, that is secured by the proceeds from the specific project the bond finances. While general bonds may be intended for maintenance and ongoing funds for governmental and civic agencies and infrastructure, an authority bond, like a municipal bond, applies to one specific project.
The risk of an authority bond correlates with the risk of the specific project the bond finances. While municipal bonds tend to finance low-risk infrastructure projects that the community is forced to use as a matter of course, authority bonds may finance projects that have varying degrees of appeal and may not earn the projected revenue.
Authority Bond vs Municipal Bond
Authority bonds are very similar to municipal bonds, and are issued by similar entities for similar purposes. There is some overlap in the types of projects they are issued for, but there are key differences. Municipal bonds tend to be issued for infrastructure projects, while authority bonds tend to be issued for community organizations or expansions of organizations. For example, a municipal bond would be issued for building a new bridge, and the bondholders would be paid back using tolls from the new bridge, while an authority bond would be issued for building a new wing on a community recreation center, and the bondholders would be paid back with membership fees or day pass fees.
Another key difference is that authority bonds incorporate margin protections, which means that bondholders are guaranteed that they haven’t overpaid for the bonds. This reduces bondholders’ risk, because the lower price means that the project doesn’t have to earn as much revenue to pay back the bondholders.
Authority bonds are a type of revenue bond, not a general obligation, or GO, bond, because they must be attached to a revenue-generating project. Municipal bonds are usually revenue bonds.
