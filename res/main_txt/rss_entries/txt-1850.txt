        The cabinet also raised the minimum sentence in cases of rape of a woman to 10 years from the current seven, and in the rape of a girl under 16 years of age to 20 years from 10. In a crime that shocked India, an 8-year-old Muslim girl in Jammu and Kashmir was kidnapped in January, drugged, held for several days in Kathua, was raped multiple times then murdered, local police said. In Uttar Pradesh, a state lawmaker from Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party is accused in a June 2017 rape case in Unnao.At the same meeting the cabinet approved an ordinance to deal with fugitive economic offenders. When it becomes a law, authorities will have the power to confiscate the property of people who have fled the country after committing an economic crime involving one billion rupees ($15.1 million) or more.The new rule to curtail economic offenses was approved months after disclosure of India’s biggest bank fraud. Jewelers Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi, accused of masterminding the fraud of more than $2 billion, left the country long before it was reported. The incident undermined government’s efforts to shore up finances of state-run banks already struggling with soured loans.
