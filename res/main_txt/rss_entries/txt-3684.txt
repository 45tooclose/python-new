Fast-casual restaurants are also close competitors, and this group includes Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG) and Panera Bread Company. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) is a specialty quick-service restaurant with an offering overlapping with McDonald’s. McDonald’s also competes with a fragmented market of takeout and casual dining restaurants. Internationally, McDonald’s faces competition from some of the largest fast food chains in addition to regional competitors and smaller local restaurants.
The burger giant is banking on using fresh beef for its quarter pounder patties to woo customers. In March 2018, the company said it had already rolled these out to more than 3,500 locations and hopes to expand this to 14,000 locations (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) by May. Here's a look at some of McDonald's competitors.
1) Starbucks
Starbucks is the world’s largest coffee house chain. As of January 2018, the company operates around 27,000 stores in 75 different countries, including 13,930 in the United States.

Starbucks markets itself as a high-quality option at a high price point.
