            Sweden’s central bank just can’t get enough inflation.Having held their key rate at minus 0.5 percent, policy makers in Stockholm again pushed  back a plan to raise interest rates for the first time in seven years, announcing on Thursday they don’t see a tightening until “towards the end of the year.” (That compares with an earlier assessment of “the second half of this year.”)“Inflation has been somewhat lower than expected recently, which raises questions regarding the strength of the development in inflation,” the bank said. “If inflation is to remain close to the target going forward, continued support is needed from monetary policy.”

        Inflation remains elusive in the largest Nordic economy, with the core price measure holding far below the 2 percent target at the tail end of a growth boom. The step back is likely to raise even more questions about the bank’s extreme policies. Critics argue that the stewards of a small economy can do little to stand up against the global forces that have pressed down inflation and are instead jeopardizing stability and debasing the currency.Led by Governor Stefan Ingves, the Riksbank’s board has invested all its credibility in anchoring inflation. Buffeted by extreme monetary policy abroad, Swedish policy makers have since 2015 been on an all-out mission to restore inflation, cutting rates deep below zero, snapping up a large chunk of the nation’s bonds and threatening currency interventions.The krona has tumbled this year, reaching the lowest level against the euro since the financial crisis as inflation remains on shaky ground and the Swedish housing market rapidly deflates after years of surging prices. Inflation, excluding energy prices, was 1.5 percent last month, below the bank’s own 1.8 percent forecast.As he did in February, Deputy Governor Henry Ohlsson entered a reservation against the decision to further delay normalization of the policy rate, again calling for an immediate quarter point increase in rates.
