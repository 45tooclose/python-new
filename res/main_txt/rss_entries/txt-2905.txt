      An asset management and disposition agreement (AMDA) was a type of contract between the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and an independent contractor that oversaw and sold the assets of failed savings and loan (S&L) institutions during the S&L crisis of the 1980s and 1990s. Asset management and disposition agreements became necessary when the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) took over numerous failed S&Ls (also called “thrifts”) during the crisis, acquiring billions of dollars’ worth of assets in the process. When the FSLIC (which was to the S&L industry what the FDIC is to the banking industry) failed during the crisis, it was abolished in 1989 and the FDIC became the head of the FSLIC Resolution Fund.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Asset Management and Disposition Agreement (AMDA)'
      Because there were more assets of failed S&Ls than the FDIC could handle on its own, the government created the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), whose purpose was to resolve all thrifts placed under conservatorship or receivership between Jan. 1, 1989, and Aug. 8, 1992. The RTC also did not have the capacity to resolve all the failed S&Ls and was required to contract the work out to the private sector where practical. Asset management and disposition agreement (AMDAs) were the partnership agreements that formed the legal framework for the work. Ninety-one contractors worked under these agreements in the early 1990s to handle $48.5 billion in assets. Asset specialists that worked for the FDIC or RTC handled or oversaw the transactions. The contractors received management fees, disposition fees and incentive fees in exchange for their work in managing performing assets and disposing of nonperforming ones. Some of the funds received through AMDAs were put toward further resolving the crisis.
AMDAs were one of many tools the government employed in resolving the S&L crisis. Some of the other tools for managing and liquidating assets during the S&L crisis included the Federal Asset Disposition Association, an FSLIC-owned and newly created S&L; asset liquidation agreements (ALAs), which were used to dispose of pools of distressed assets worth at least $1 billion; and regional ALAs for smaller pools of less than $500 million. In total, the RTC liquidated 747 insolvent S&Ls during the crisis.
