I have fond childhood memories of our local bank. A sturdy, brink affair that exuded safety and security. My mom and I would take my birthday or paper route money to the bank. We'd deposit the money in my passbook savings account, and the teller would stamp my passbook. Oh, and at times I earned north of 10%.

Times have changed, to say the least. 
With our children, my wife and I used the Capital One 360 Money card. It was tied to our Capital One 360 account, and it gave our children all the banking services they needed. It even allowed for direct deposit of their paychecks while they worked during high school. 
Now a new offer has entered the teen market. The Greenlight prepaid debit card for kids describes itself as the "smart debit card for kids." Let's see just how smart it is. 
Greenlight Debit Card for Kids 
 
  
On the surface, Greenlight is a standard MasterCard debit card. It can be used anywhere that accepts MasterCard, and it works like any other debit card. Parents or teens can add money to the card, which then can be used in-person or online. 
Greenlight also accepts direct deposit. When your child gets a job, they can have their paycheck deposited directly into the Greenlight account.
