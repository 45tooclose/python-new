        "I wouldn’t say it was just because of Donald Trump, but Donald Trump makes it click in your head that this actually has a much wider impact," he told the parliamentary committee. " I don’t think that military-style information operations is conducive for any democratic process."During the U.K. appearance, some lawmakers questioned Wylie on the links between Cambridge Analytica, its parent company SCL, and work on various political campaigns including Britain’s 2016 vote to leave the European Union. He said that vote might have come out differently "had there not been, in my view, cheating."Wylie also tweeted over the weekend that he would "be happy to speak to the European Parliament.""There are actually more active Facebook users in the EU than in the USA, which makes Mark Zuckerberg’s reluctance to address international lawmakers all the more disappointing," Wylie said of the Facebook chief executive officer, who appeared earlier this month before U.S. congressional committees.
