In a speech at the World ‎Economic Forum in Davos, the legendary investor said: “cryptocurrency is a misnomer and is a typical bubble, which is always ‎based on some kind of misunderstanding.”‎“Bitcoin is not a currency because a currency is supposed to be a stable ‎store of value and the currency that can fluctuate 25% in a day can’t be ‎used for instance to pay wages because wages drop by 25% in a day. It’s ‎a speculation,” he added.‎While clearer revelations on Soros Fund Management’s involvement in ‎cryptocurrencies have come out now, the interest in the space ‎isn’t new. The New York-based fund, which manages about $30 ‎billion, has bought last year a large amount of stock in Overstock, the online retailer that attracted attention since detailing plans to launch a digital-token exchange.Soros won a place in finance history by heavily betting ‎that sterling would fall and was dubbed the man who ‎‎“broke” the Bank of England in 1992 when he bet against ‎the pound and made a reported $1 billion.‎Soros’s fund wasn’t the only investor who seems to have ‎interest in cryptocurrencies. Other high-profile investors have taken the same approach position, including former macro fund ‎manager Mike Novogratz and billionaire investors Mark Cuban and Peter Thiel.‎ However, the optimism by mainstream institutions and professional investors has not stopped the ‎cryptocurrency market from plummeting over the last three months. ‎ googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this articleRelated News Exclusive: Facebook to Launch its Own Cryptocurrency with Massive ICO  Mayor of Seoul Announces City Cryptocurrency  “Powerful Implications” – Bitcoin Reveals Government Currency Controls  Got a news tip?
