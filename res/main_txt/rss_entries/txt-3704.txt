Here are three reasons why.It Makes the Market AccessibleThe team at Tkeycoin took an economic and scientific approach to the cryptocurrency market — mixing the best aspects of Bitcoin, Ethereum, DASH, and other digital currencies with the best real-world experiences from heavy hitters like IBM and Microsoft.With this approach, Tkeycoin aims to make the cryptocurrency market as widely available as possible. In order to achieve this, the project’s cryptocurrency aims to become a widely accepted payment by taking on all of the properties of traditional fiat currency. As such, users will be able to make both online and offline payments anywhere traditional credit cards are accepted — such as in shops, restaurants, public institutions, etc.Tkeycoin may effectively eliminate the need for cash by creating a balanced ecosystem which better suits both cryptocurrencies and society at large.Up to 500,000 Transactions Per SecondTkeycoin’s blockchain protocol is secured by the encryption system Iron Atom Technology, RSA2048, Curve25519, which offers a complete Turing platform complete with secure smart contract technology. This means that the Tkeycoin’s blockchain offers lightning fast, secure, rock-solid, and anonymous transactions — providing real-world use cases in a variety of economic sectors.By “lightning fast,” we mean that Tkeycoin’s blockchain is capable of processing 500,000 transactions per second, thanks to the use of an advanced mechanism for tracing circuits and algorithms of artificial intelligence. Essentially, this allows for the system to use parallel chains when the maximum transaction rate is reached — creating interconnected branches of the same block structure.Privacy-concerned users may also take advantage of the TBP Protocol, which allows for both verified and anonymous transactions. As such, Tkeycoin is perfect for use at the governmental and corporate levels.A Robust International Marketplace and Freelance ExchangeA cryptocurrency is nothing without a productive use case. For Tkeycoin, that means building a productive economy with a cycle of use of goods and services on both the local and global levels. Providing an international marketplace will effectively bring together thousands, if not millions, of sellers and manufacturers from anywhere in the world.Sellers’ histories are recorded in a decentralized magazine, and the Tkeycoin system features the implementation of a verification protocol, which ensures that ratings are verified, transparent, and fair. Only users who made a purchase may leave feedback on an individual store, and business accounts likewise may only rate users who made purchases. Reviews are stored for three years — promoting proper business practices and behavior.There is also a freelance exchange, which is beneficial to both users and business owners. Users may act as freelancers and contribute to the system while receiving payment in Tkeycoin (TCD) cryptocurrency. In return, businesses receive a wide variety of services for their development.Finally, on the subject of Tkeycoins, holders are able to mine coins from 3000 TCD. Users freeze their amount and do not use it. Therefore, most coins will be stored in the system. This means that large amounts will not be exchanged into fiat currencies. A good investor understands that it is possible to freeze some of their savings to get a constant percentage of production. There are no other ways to get coins.For more information about Tkeycoin please visit tkeycoin.com and be sure to download the project whitepaper (available in 9 languages).
