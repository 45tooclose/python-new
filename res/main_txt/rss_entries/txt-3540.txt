            U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May has named Sajid Javid, a 48-year-old euroskeptic, as home secretary in an appointment that could tip the balance of power in the Cabinet toward a harder Brexit.His predecessor Amber Rudd was a key pro-European Union voice who provided a counterpoint to pro-Brexit heavyweights, including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Environment Secretary Michael Gove. Javid, a former banker, will attend a key meeting of the Brexit “war cabinet” on Wednesday that will weigh up what kind of future relationship the U.K. will seek with the EU after the split.#lazy-img-327208282:before{padding-top:66.68334167083543%;}Sajid JavidPhotographer: Jason Alden/BloombergJavid campaigned for Remain during the 2016 referendum but was never seen as very committed to that cause and has since come out as a firm Leaver. He has been clear that the U.K. should leave the customs union.

        The fight over the customs union is one that’s dominating domestic politics as negotiations with Brussels make little progress. Businesses, the opposition Labour Party and some pro-EU Conservative rebels want the U.K. to remain inside it to ease cross-border trade.While the appointment of Javid tips the balance of May’s war cabinet in favor of a harder Brexit, ultimately Parliament could end up deciding what kind of divorce Britain gets. There’s probably a majority in the House of Commons for staying in the customs union and  a vote that could force May’s hand could come as soon as next month.The BankerAlthough they both opposed Brexit in the referendum, Javid’s views on the subject are very different to Rudd’s. He was blooded in Conservative politics as a student campaigner against membership of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. His banking career gave him a global perspective -- he ran Deutsche Bank’s trading operations in Singapore before entering politics.In the run-up to the referendum, Javid seriously considered joining the Leave campaign, according to people close to him, before being persuaded reluctantly to back Remain, partly because of his fears of the economic impact of Brexit and partly out of loyalty to then-Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne.Read our 2013 profile of the man who’s risen up the Conservative ranks

        He is a former managing director at Deutsche Bank AG, who has also served as business secretary and culture secretary. A high-achiever, Javid became a vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank aged just 25. He now becomes the first ethnic minority holder of the Home Office in the post’s 236-year history.
