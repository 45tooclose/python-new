      Open-market rate is the rate of interest that is paid on any debt security that trades in the open market. Open-market rates are sensitive and can fluctuate frequently, as they respond directly to changes in supply and demand. Interest rates for such debt instruments as commercial paper and banker's acceptances would fall under the category of open-market rates.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Open-Market Rate'
      Open-market rate differs from the discount rate and other official rates that are set by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, a committee within the Federal Reserve system, establishes a target for the federal funds rate, which is the interest that banks charge each other to makes overnight loans from their Federal Reserve funds. The FOMC then uses activity within the open market for government securities to try and achieve that rate. This rate is important because the federal funds rate in turn influences other major categories of interest rates, including the open-market rate.
It is important to distinguish between open-market rate and open-market operations. The latter is the structure in which the Federal Reserve can affect and control the supply of reserve balances available in the banking system. This is one of the primary tactics used by the Federal Reserve to implement monetary policy. Open-market operations typically involve the buying and selling of government securities by one central bank in the open market. This allows for the expansion or reduction of the amount of money in the banking system at a given time. The purchase of securities creates an infusion of money into the banking system, which promotes growth. By contrast, when securities are sold, this will have the opposite effect and will shrink the economy.
Open-market rates and the secondary market
The open-market rates apply to any debt instrument that trades in the secondary market, where investors buy and sell securities from each other, as opposed to buying them directly from the issuing company. This is sometimes also referred to as the aftermarket, and involves investors making deals amongst themselves, without having to deal with the entity that original issued the securities. This type of trading activity is what most people probably envision when they think about the stock market. The secondary market is a category that would include the well-known national exchanges such as the NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange. Bank commercial-loan rates do not fall into this category, as they are largely determined by Fed policy.
