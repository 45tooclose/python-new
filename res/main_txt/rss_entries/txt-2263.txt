            Credit Suisse Group AG is seeking to reclaim hundreds of millions in taxes from a controversial U.K. bonus levy that hit banker compensation in 2010.The Swiss lender is preparing for a London trial against the British tax authority over the one-off 50 percent tax on banker bonuses of more than 25,000 pounds, lawyers for the bank said at a court hearing Monday. Credit Suisse paid 440 million Swiss francs ($450 million) for the tax.The tax implemented by the Labour government in the wake of popular anger over lavish banker bonuses following the global financial crisis generated 3.4 billion pounds ($4.8 billion), almost five times higher than initial estimates. Credit Suisse, which didn’t take a government bailout, is asking whether the tax should be considered a state-aid measure.

        Credit Suisse cut its global bonus pool by 5 percent to help fund the cost of the tax, while its 400 U.K.-based managing directors saw their pot slashed by a further 30 percent. The firm is now seeking both repayment and damages, citing the "arbitrary impact" of the levy.Credit Suisse has a legitimate interest in pursuing formal proceedings "to provide certainty as to the proper scope and application of the 2010 one-off tax,” the bank said in an emailed statement. Credit Suisse "has sought to resolve Bank Payroll Tax-related issues over a number of years."The bank’s lawsuit is "too late and in the wrong place," George Peretz, a lawyer for the tax authority, HM Revenue and Customs, said at the hearing. A representative for HMRC declined to comment.A trial is scheduled for the summer of 2019.
