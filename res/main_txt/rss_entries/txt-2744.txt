      A death bond is a security backed by life insurance which is derived by pooling together a number of transferable life insurance policies. Similar to mortgage-backed securities, the life insurance policies are pooled together and then repackaged into bonds to be sold to investors.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Death Bond'
      Death bonds can trace their origins to viatical settlements in the 1980s. During this time, AIDS and other terminally ill patients needed money to pay for their expensive medicines, so they began selling their life insurance policies and were paid an up-front amount. Their policy payments were taken over by the purchasers, who would receive the policy paid in full when the patients died.
Death bonds provide investors with an unusual instrument that is less affected by standard financial risks. One risk of holding a death bond lies with the underlying insured person. If the person lives longer than expected, the bond's yield will begin declining. However, because the death bonds are created from an underlying pool of assets, the individual risk associated with one policy is spread out, making the instruments more stable.
In general, a life insurance policy holder transfers his or her policy to a life settlement company in exchange for more money than the cash surrender value of the policy, but less than the face value. The life settlement company resells the policy to an investment bank which pools and repackages the life insurance with other policies into bonds to be sold to investors. The returns on death bonds are generally higher than U.S. treasuries, but less than equity investments.
Pros and Cons of ‘Death Bonds’
Death bonds can provide diversification for investors with holdings in commodities, housing, and other financial markets. They have a high yield that is not impacted by market forces. Indeed, if the seller of the life insurance policy dies earlier, the buyer will benefit. Death bonds offer tax-free income, because life insurance policies carry neither capital gains taxes nor regular taxes, since they are typically used to pay the funeral expenses of the deceased. 
Some have expressed concerns about death bonds and the securitization of life insurance policies, drawing comparisons to the collateralized debt obligations that contributed to the collapse of the housing market in 2008-09. Since there are no regulations or requirements for the industry, virtually anyone can hang a sign on their door and become involved in the life-settlement business. This makes it very difficult for investors to get enough information about how risk appropriate an investment vehicle like death bonds will be for their portfolio.
