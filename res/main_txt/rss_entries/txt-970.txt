            President Donald Trump pardoned I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby for lying to investigators probing the leak of CIA officer Valerie Plame’s identity.“I don’t know Mr. Libby,” Trump said in a statement, “but for years I have heard that he has been treated unfairly. Hopefully, this full pardon will help rectify a very sad portion of his life.”Libby, who was an aide to then-Vice President Dick Cheney, was the “victim of a special counsel run amok,” White House aide Kellyanne Conway told reporters on Friday, echoing a portrayal that Trump has applied to himself in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

        President George W. Bush commuted Libby’s 30-month prison sentence while leaving the 2007 conviction intact. Democrats decried the move, while many conservatives--including John Bolton, Trump’s new national security adviser -- said Bush should have pardoned Libby.Trump’s pardon offers Libby official forgiveness, and could help him re-emerge in conservative politics.Plame and her husband, former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson, later sued Cheney, Libby and Bush’s political adviser, Karl Rove, and then-Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, claiming they conspired to reveal Plame’s identity as a CIA agent. The pair accused the four men of leaking Plame’s identity to the media in retaliation for a New York Times opinion piece by Wilson that questioned the Bush administration’s basis for going to war in Iraq.The lawsuit was dismissed.Libby is the third person Trump has pardoned since taking office. He drew cheers in some conservative circles and wide condemnation from Democrats when he pardoned Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, last year. Arpaio had been convicted of criminal contempt of court after investigators found that his office had continued racial profiling and so-called immigration round-ups after a federal court barred him from doing so.

        Trump also in March pardoned Kristian Saucier, a former Navy sailor prosecuted for taking photographs of classified engineering areas of a nuclear-powered submarine.
