            A Syrian airbase was hit with a missile attack early on Monday, the country’s official news agency reported, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump warned of a “big price to pay” in response to reports of a chemical attack outside the nation’s capital.The Pentagon said it wasn’t conducting airstrikes, with a spokesman saying that “we continue to closely watch the situation.” The use of chemical weapons in April 2017 provoked a U.S. missile strike, the first direct American hit on Bashar al-Assad’s regime since the conflict in Syria began in March 2011.Rescue workers and activists said dozens died over the weekend in a chemical assault amid renewed fire by Assad’s government on a rebel stronghold near Damascus.
