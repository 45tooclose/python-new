            Germany wants to help U.K. banks get access to the European market after Brexit, but would need Britain to make concessions, according to a person familiar with the German government’s position.With Brexit talks bogged down in divorce issues, the outlook for Britain’s financial services sector hasn’t been discussed yet. But the European Commission, which is leading negotiations on the EU side, has rejected the U.K.’s proposal for how its banks should operate in Europe after the split and is offering much more limited access instead.The U.K. sees an opportunity to exploit in lingering divisions among EU member countries. In Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, Chancellor Angela Merkel consistently has said she wants to limit disruption to economic ties.

        As things stand, the EU will offer the U.K. access based on so-called equivalence, meaning the Commission unilaterally decides if another country’s rules are up to scratch. The U.K. rejects that approach as too limited in scope and unreliable as the EU can withdraw authorization at short notice.Running parallel to Brexit negotiations, the EU is revising its rules on equivalence. They may be tightened further, making the EU’s offer even less attractive to U.K. institutions.
