            President Donald Trump has endorsed letting states decide how to regulate marijuana, in a major boost for the legal pot industry, Colorado Republican Senator Cory Gardner said.Gardner said that as a result of Trump’s assurances he’ll end a blockade of Justice Department nominees. Gardner held up the nominees after Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded an earlier Justice Department memo that shielded marijuana operations in states like Colorado from enforcement of the federal ban on the drug."Since the campaign, President Trump has consistently supported states’ rights to decide for themselves how best to approach marijuana," Gardner said in a statement Friday. “President Trump has assured me that he will support a federalism-based legislative solution to fix this states’ rights issue once and for all.”

        Marijuana stocks jumped after Gardner’s statement.Gardner said he’s lifting his hold and working with colleagues on legislation that would protect marijuana operations in states that have legalized the drug.
