Xi and Modi would have “communications of a strategic nature concerning big changes happening in the world,” Wang told reporters in Beijing.“They will also exchange views on overall, long-term and strategic matters concerning the future of China-India relations,” Wang said, citing the rapid growth of both countries. “This makes for a more balanced international geometry and a stronger trend toward peace.”Fundamental Interest

        Xi and Modi last met in September, when they held their first talks since defusing a border stand-off in remote region between India, Bhutan and China’s Tibet region. A healthy, stable relationship is in the fundamental interest of both nations, Xi said after that meeting, which took place at the conclusion of a summit of so-called BRICS nations in China’s Xiamen.India and China together comprise more than one-third of the world’s population and account for 18 percent of global gross domestic product. Add to that the symbiotic trade relationship between the two major Asian economies, and there’s a lot at stake.“While making efforts to progress our relations in diverse areas, we underlined that maintaining peace and tranquility in the India-China border areas is an essential prerequisite for the smooth development of bilateral relations,” Swaraj said.— With assistance by Iain Marlow, and Keith Zhai
