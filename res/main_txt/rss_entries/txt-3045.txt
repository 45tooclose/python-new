(FB) rallied some 9% on Thursday on a first-quarter earnings beat, the stock has still underperformed the broader market this year, down 1.3% year-to-date (YTD) compared to the S&P 500's 0.3% decline. As the tech titan's shares stay cheap relative to the larger market and its high-flying peers, some bulls, indicating that bad news is already priced into shares, instead look to its solid revenue and profit forecast and recommend buying on the dip. (See also: Apple Vs.

Last month, news of a data breach involving Cambridge Analytica, in which the political data analysis firm got information on over 87 million Facebook users without their consent to aid the Trump campaign in the 2016 U.S. presidential race, sent shares of the high flying FAANG stock on a roller-coaster ride. About $100 billion was wiped from Facebook's market capitalization in the week's following the most recent data scandal, until Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg's appearance in front of Congress began to ease investors' worries. 
In Q1, the Menlo Park, California-based company posted both top line and bottom line results above the consensus estimate, as well as an additional $9 billion for a stock buyback plan. 
Worries Outweighed by Earnings Blowout
“Despite facing important challenges, our community and business are off to a strong start in 2018,” said Zuckerberg in on a conference call Wednesday afternoon. “Over the next three years we’re going to keep building Facebook to not only be a service that people love to use, but also one that’s good for people and good for society.”
The Facebook founder and CEO assured analysts that the firm is investing "heavily" on safety and security, and in "building the experiences that bring people together on Facebook in the first place." 
Jim Cramer, speaking on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street," suggested that, "when you get a quarter like that, it's almost as if nothing ever happened." The investor, whose charitable trust owns FB, stated that the social media giant may arguably be the "cheapest stock in the S&P 500," adding, "Maybe that's why they're buying back $9 billion worth of stock." 
'Too Cheap to Ignore'
The blowout earnings led one Wall Street analyst to take back his downgrade of FB shares earlier this year. "We chose to stick with our recent view on Facebook and were wrong to do so," wrote Stifel analyst Scott Devitt in a note to clients Thursday. "Facebook stock is too cheap to ignore."
Closing at a price of $174.16 on Thursday, FB shares trade at a price to earnings multiple of 32.3, compared to the average Nasdaq Composite Index company at 33.5. 
Despite fears over momentum of a #DeleteFacebook movement, results supported Zuckerberg's earlier statements suggesting that Cambridge Analytica and its aftermath had no significant impact on the business. Facebook boasts 1.45 billion daily users and 2.2 billion monthly users. Impressions, a key indicator of advertiser demand, grew 8% in the quarter, while ad prices rose 39% over last year. 
Facebook stock's forward 2018 price to earnings ratio of 22.5, compares to that of Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) at 26.5 times, Netflix Inc. (NFLX) at 110.7 times, Apple Inc. (AAPL) at 14.5 times and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) at 168.8 times. (See also: Facebook to Be Sued in UK Over Fake Bitcoin Ads.)
