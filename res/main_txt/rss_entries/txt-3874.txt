      Debt limitation is a bond covenant that limits or restricts any additional debt that may be incurred by the issuer before the bond reaches maturity. Debt limitations are intended to protect the current lenders by maintaining the firm's degree of leverage. The goal is to try and lessen the risk of default, and minimize potential losses by investors should a default occur.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Debt Limitation'
      A debt limitation may take a variety of forms, depending on the circumstances of the debt issue. For financially sound firms, lenders may only want to maintain the current levels of leverage and implement a covenant relating to the debt-service coverage ratio. This would allow the firm to borrow more funds when it increases its net income. If the firm appears risky, lenders may not want it to incur additional debt. The covenant may specify a maximum level of debt in a dollar amount, despite any growth in operations. If certain type of debt or that which is earmarked for specific purposes is limited as per the terms of a covenant, that is known as a debt basket.
In more extreme cases, the lenders may demand that no additional debt be incurred until their bonds have been repaid. The more restrictive forms of debt limitations are most likely to be implemented when the issuer’s financial status is questionable or unstable and there is a fear that junk bonds will be issued. Debt limitation is different from a debt limit, which is the maximum amount of debt a country or its government is allowed to take on, as dictated by law.
Debt limitation is one type of covenant
A covenant is a protective instrument included in investing or borrowing agreements. The covenant is designed to help protect lenders and investors by decreasing the odds that a borrower will default, or minimizing the financial obligations and commitments the borrower can incur that may compete against their existing debt agreements. These covenants are legally binding and enforceable. A debt limitation is just one type of covenant. There are numerous other types. Some of these include restricted payments, limitations on liens and limits on sales of equity interests. Restrictive conditions may also be placed on the sale or merger of assets. Covenants are especially common with high-yield bonds. The types of covenants found with these bonds are called incurrence covenants because they only would be triggered when the company takes a certain action, such as when it incurs additional debt.
