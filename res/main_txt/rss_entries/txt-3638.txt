      Right-shoring is the placement of a business' components and processes in localities and countries that provide the best combination of cost and efficiency. It is a strategy in which a business analyzes the complexity and importance of required tasks and entrusts their completion with the most suitable workforce, regardless of location. Right-shoring may involve moving some operations to cheaper locations overseas or other cities or states, while retaining core operations and processes at a local headquarters.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Right-Shoring'
      Right-shoring requires a business to maintain a balance between the work types that can be outsourced overseas and the ones that should be kept domestic. Commonly, less complex types of work and work that carries a lower level of importance can be shifted abroad, while complex and important types, or ones that require extensive customer interaction, are kept at home.
