During the first week company had already got another 13 clients waiting for new ATM all over the world, including Slovakia, China, France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Finland, Denmark, Sweden and Brazil. Harvey mentioned the names of two next places where produced machines are going – the Crypto-Currency Conference in Atlanta and the Money2020 Conference in Las Vegas. In the second run company is going to ship over 25 units in late November. The company is now accepting orders for the third run, which will ship in the first quarter of 2014.
