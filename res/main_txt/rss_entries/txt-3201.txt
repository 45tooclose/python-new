Elkins Jr. confirmed the probe in letters to Democratic Representatives Don Beyer and Ted Lieu, who had requested the inquiry.#lazy-img-327034416:before{padding-top:66.68181818181817%;}Scott PruittPhotographer: T.J.

        Pruitt was allowed to pay $50 per day to lease the space, but only on the nights he stayed there.Previously, the EPA’s top ethics officer said the lease itself didn’t violate federal ethics regulations barring certain gifts. But he didn’t examine whether the arrangement with a lobbyist violated other ethics rules, nor whether the actual use of the space was consistent with the lease agreement.— With assistance by Ari Natter
