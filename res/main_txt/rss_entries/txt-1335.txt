            U.S. Supreme Court justices signaled they are divided about whether to let states start collecting billions of dollars in sales taxes from internet retailers that don’t currently charge tax to their customers.Hearing arguments in Washington, the justices considered overturning their 1992 ruling that made much of the internet a tax-free zone by exempting retailers that don’t have a physical presence in the state.Three justices -- Anthony Kennedy, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas -- have already indicated they would overturn the 1992 ruling. In Tuesday’s argument, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested she would join them.

        But Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Samuel Alito indicated they were reluctant to take that step.
