            An international banker charged in the U.S. with laundering more than $100 million for an Iranian construction company “grossly” understated his net worth, prosecutors said in opposing his request to be freed on bail before a trial.Ali Sadr Hashemi Nejad, a Cornell- and Wharton-educated banker with Iranian and St. Kitts and Nevis citizenships, told the prosecutors that he had as much as $4.6 million in assets in the U.S. and Cyprus. But in recent years, he reported assets of as much as $47 million, prosecutors said. He also failed to report additional entities he controls and bank accounts related to them containing tens of millions more, according to the U.S.That gives him the resources to flee the U.S. before a trial, prosecutors said. A hearing was scheduled in Manhattan Wednesday for Sadr’s lawyers to request bail for their client, but they asked for a delay while they investigate and respond to the new allegations.

        U.S. District Judge Andrew L. Carter wondered if that was enough, saying he feared Sadr could simply repay his backers if he skipped bail.“You don’t need to be Bill Gates to write a check for $13 million,” Carter said. “You could be P. Diddy.”The case is U.S. v Nejad, 18-cr-224, US District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
