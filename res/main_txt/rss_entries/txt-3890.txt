      Survivor bond is a type of bond whose future coupons are based on the percentage of a stated population group who are still alive on the future coupon payment dates. In other words, the remaining survivors of that group. The payouts of these coupons are dependent on the proportion of the group that survive to a certain age. These types of bonds can be used as part of a risk management strategy. As mortality increases and survivors of the group decrease over time, coupon payments decline until they eventually reach zero. Survivor bonds are used by annuity providers and pension plan managers to hedge aggregate longevity risk. This is a way for providers and plan issuers to try and mitigate risk exposure.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Survivor Bond'
      Survivor bonds are based on the idea of longevity risk. The term “longevity risk” refers to the risk of loss sustained from an unanticipated reduction in mortality rates and a corresponding increase in longevity. In simple terms, that means that people benefitting from a particular plan or payout may live longer than expected, or longer than that which would make the plan as profitable as planned in the ideal scenario. While advances in health care and medicine have led to sustained increases in life expectancy over the years, aging populations are putting severe financial pressure on government pension plans around the world. Survivor bonds help annuity providers and pension plans hedge this risk, since these bonds are ideal for matching their liabilities in the presence of longevity risk.
The terms “longevity risk” and “mortality risk” are sometimes used interchangeably, and can often be used to mean the same thing. However, mortality risk can also be a way to express the idea that a plan participant can die at any time, whether that be later than statistically expected or sooner. This combination of longevity risk and mortality risk presents a level of considerable uncertainty to the operation of these plans, and can make it difficult to predict their total payments, or how long that period of payments may last.
Survivor bonds and increasing lifespans
The overall trend in the United States and other Western countries is that life expectancies have been steadily increasing. While the fact that people are enjoying longer lives would generally be seen as a good thing, it can be problematic for pension plan managers and annuity providers because they need to adjust their payout expectations, and alter their financial strategy to accommodate this period of payouts that may be longer than anticipated.
