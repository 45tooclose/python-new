 Open source software publisher Block.one pre-released its scalability-focused Blockchain platform EOSIO Dawn 3.0 on Github yesterday, April 6, according to an EOSIO Medium post.Dawn 2.0 had been released in December of last year, and the most current pre-release of Dawn 3.0 this April 6 is noted as a “major milestone on the road to EOSIO 1.0,” which reportedly will be released in June.Earlier this month, Block.one and German fintech incubator FinLab AG announced a partnership for developing EOS software with $100 mln of funding.EOSIO’s Medium post writes that that “we think we have achieved” the goal for inter-Blockchain communication, which they describe as the “the ultimate scalability featureâ—âthe holy grailâ—âthat the industry has been searching for,” to be “as secure as intra-chain communication between smart contracts.”Dawn 3.0 contains many new features that “were not even contemplated in the original EOSIO White Paper,” most notably the capability to “accelerate throughput without hard forking changes” through parallel computation, the “ability to implement a light client as a smart contract,” the implementation of context free actions whose validation computation can be “pruned from replay,” and the addition of a new resource rate liming system.The Medium post continues by reporting one of Dawn 3.0’s “most significant features,” which is a user-configurable delay for various actions that will allow a user to know they have been hacked before a hacker’s transaction goes through, because the delay broadcasts the transaction to the Blockchain for whatever amount of time chosen before it can be applied.EOSIO can be used without tokens in private and permissioned Blockchains, has a .5 second block interval, and uses a “hello world” contract development that contains only “a few simple lines of code.”The Medium post ends with encouragement to EOSIO public network to “operate as many chains as necessary to meet user demand,” in order to create the “maximum possible network effect around a single token and leverage the trust and security of economic incentives created by high-market capitalization tokens.”Other Blockchain scalability projects in the crypto ecosystem include PHANTOM, a scalable BlockDAG - an alternative structure to Blockchain protocol - which was introduced in an academic paper in early February.
