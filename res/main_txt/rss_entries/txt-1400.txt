            Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, 66, has said he will reshuffle his cabinet soon and is widely expected to do so before Parliament reconvenes on May 7. The impending changes will increase the focus on a group of younger ministers -- with an average age of about 50 -- equipping them with more exposure and added responsibilities.Lee has signaled he doesn’t want to stay in power beyond the age of 70, and speculation on who his successor might be is intensifying. His People’s Action Party has been in power since Singapore’s independence in 1965, and is expected to rule for the foreseeable future.What the current contenders end up doing in the revamped cabinet will be watched as a signal of where they stand and how the gaps in their experience are being plugged. The next generation of leaders will need to navigate risks associated with an aging population, a maturing economy and the tide of rising protectionism globally.Here are the faces to watch:Chan Chun Sing (49 this year)#lazy-img-326619744:before{padding-top:125%;}Chan Chun SingPhotographer: Roslan Rahman/AFP via Getty Images
