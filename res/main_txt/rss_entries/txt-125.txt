Investing in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin is still a game that can make people rich and truly free, according to some experts. 
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have made many people very rich, very quickly — people who purchased into these cryptocurrencies early, before they ran their exponential course. 
But they have made many people very poor very quickly, too—people who purchased these cryptocurrencies near their all-time highs, before they got crushed. 
[Ed. note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. Disclosure: I don't own any Bitcoin.] 
"It's safe to say that the price action in the crypto market over the past few months has been very ugly,” says Investing.com Senior Analyst Jesse Cohen. “All the major coins have suffered steep double-digit declines since the start of the year and are all trading below their respective 200-day moving averages, which usually signals more losses ahead.”
