I just found out that Roger has changed the website back to listing bcash as ‘Bitcoin Cash (BCH)’ instead of just Bitcoin. So for that, the lawsuit has already done some good. So carry on!I retract my statement calling the lawsuit stupid. I just found out that Roger has changed the website back to listing bcash as "Bitcoin Cash (BCH)" instead of just Bitcoin. So for that, the lawsuit has already done some good. So carry on!— Charlie Lee [LTC] (@SatoshiLite) May 1, 2018Other supporters of the lawsuit currently include Charlie Shrem and Richard Heart, as well as Nakamoto Institute founder Pierre Rochard and entrepreneur Alistair Milne.In a curious step, Calvin Ayre’s Coingeek issued a statement also endorsing the action, the publication just last year claiming conversely that Bitcoin Cash was the “only” Bitcoin.yep even more changes?im sure their legal team confirmed it, they were breaking numerous laws.any sane ethical person running a business knows this, they just never thought anybody would have the balls to step up.even block explorer and currency selector changed the fraud pic.twitter.com/kwcH98pPjN— MoneyTrigz (@moneytrigz) May 1, 2018Bitcoin Think editor Beautyon similarly added support on social media.“They can’t undo the fraud they’ve already done,” he summarized.What do you think about Bitcoin.com changing its website content?
