The proposed takeover saw many twists and turns, such as on January 16, 2018 when Qualcomm held a surprise proxy meeting involving their strategy to fight back against Broadcom's takeover. These announcements included a $1 billion expense reduction program, and a video in which CEO Steve Mollenkopf urged shareholders to reject Broadcom's proposal.
This is not the only test that the company has had to face recently. Qualcomm's woes increased when the European Union fined the company $1.2 billion, claiming that the tech giant had offered financial incentives to Apple so they would be the only chip maker suppling equipment to the company and that they had used their dominance to squeeze out other competition from popping up. Add onto this an ongoing lawsuit against Apple over pricing issues, an ongoing acquisition fight of their own to buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), offering up a reported $44 billion, and things haven't been exactly drama-free over at Qualcomm. 
These are the shareholders who will surely be watching closely in the coming months. 
According to Qualcomm Inc.'s Jan. 2 proxy statement, its largest beneficial shareholder was BlackRock Inc. (NYSE: BLK) with 109 million shares, 7.37% of the outstanding shares.  Vanguard Group Inc. was the second-largest beneficial holder with 105 million shares, or 7.1% of outstanding shares. The third largest beneficial holder is CEO Steve Mollenkopf, who has 442,818 shares. 
While Blackrock's Qualcomm holdings are spread among several investment vehicles and funds, Vanguard's are more concentrated in its larger mutual funds. Two of Vanguard's funds make up the top two mutual fund investors in Qualcomm, with the ever-present SPY coming in at #3.
