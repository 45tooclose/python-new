      A break is a sudden price jump customarily associated with an unforeseen external factor. Breaks can occur higher or lower. A crash is an extreme form of a break to the downside. If a break is large enough, it will trigger safety measures by the exchange to temporarily halt trading for a limited period or the rest of the trading session.
Other words for break include "gap" in bar charting and "window" in candlestick charting. In accounting, a break can be a discrepancy in the books of a brokerage firm.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Break'
      In usually trading markets, price changes are incremental, and any sustained movement typically occurs in trends. When an external factor, such as company news or surprise government action, causes supply and demand to move so far from equilibrium, order flow stops. The market price must adjust quickly and sharply to restore balance and accommodate buy and sell orders.
Breaks are not necessarily negative as they can occur to the upside. They could be the result of an announced merger, an awarded patent or a sudden breakthrough affecting a specific commodity market.
While breaks can and do occur intraday, the most significant often happen between trading sessions. For example, when a geopolitical hostility arises over the weekend, or a weather event strikes a refinery or mine overnight. Because there is no trading, the supply and demand imbalance builds for a more extended period. On resumption of trading, the market will break sharply. The advent of after- and before-hours trading alleviated some of these pressures. Also, for markets that trade, more or less continuously, such as the currency markets, breaks are relatively rare.
Charting Breaks
When charting securities, regular open, day high or low, and close charts, typically bar and candlestick charts, are useful tools to see breaks that have already occurred. These breaks, called gaps, are areas on the chart where no trading takes place. This lack of trading leaves a gap in the trend. These levels often result in support and resistance levels going forward.
Traders exploit breaks in several ways. Breaks which occur as a trading range ends typically kick off new trends in the direction of the break. Breaks that happen after a sharp trend already occurred could signal exhaustion of that current trend. An analogy would be the final burn of a rocket's fuel as vapors completely ignite for the last burst of speed.
Not all breaks mean the trend is changing. Some occur on news that seems better, or worse than it is causing all gains or losses from the break to reverse quickly. In this case, traders use them as signals to fade the move by selling into the jump up or buying into the jump down.
