  Robert Jackson, a commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Monday the US regulator wanted to protect investors from initial coin offering (ICO) fraud and scams but was open to a legal method for raising crypto funds. Jackson hinted that making ICOs comply with securities laws might be one option.

“Investors are having a hard time telling the difference between investments and fraud. Down the road, I think we will be thinking about ways to make those investments work consistent with our securities laws,” he said.

The SEC has become very active this year at charging and subpoenaing startups and companies conducting ICOs on concerns of ICO scams and frauds. Despite that, the agency does not want to ban them, as China did last year, and is open to supporting a legal way of fund-raising.

When asked if legal way implied more regulation or a direct ban, Jackson clarified:

“It doesn't suggest either of those things. Right now we are focused on protecting investors who are getting hurt in this market.”

The commissioner stressed the need for regulation and stated that other markets might look similar if left without oversight.

“If you want to know what our markets would look like with no securities regulation, what it would look like if the SEC didn't do its job? The answer is the ICO market,” he said.

As of today, the SEC considers most ICO-based tokens as securities and expects startups to be compliant. In recent months, the agency has issued several warnings, addressing ICO pump-and-dump schemes and other types of fraud. The SEC has also subpoenaed several crypto and blockchain-oriented companies, including Riot Blockchain.
At the beginning of March, the SEC contributed directly to the bearish trend in the crypto market by announcing that crypto exchanges which provide ICO token trading solutions have to register with the regulator.
