We are referring to the acquisition of NEX Group by the Chicago-based CME Group.The CME has established a new corporate entity called CME London Limited which will be executing the bid for the company after the boards of NEX Group, CME London Limited and the CME Group have previously announced that they reached an agreement on the terms of the deal.The Scheme Document which details the different phases of the acquisition has been sent to shareholders of the London-headquartered Group earlier today. It contains a letter from the Chairman of NEX, the full terms and conditions of the Scheme and the Acquisition by CME Group as well as notices about the meetings where shareholders are expected to take action on the CME’s proposal.The approval is scheduled for the Court Meeting and the General Meeting which will be held at the registered office of NEX, at 2 Broadgate, London EC2M 7UR, on the 18th of May 2018 at 10.30 a.m. and 10.40 a.m., respectively.The Scheme document will have to be approved by shareholders before the deal can proceed. The valuation which was put on NEX Group should be enough of an incentive for shareholders to approve this acquisition. As we have pointed out in a previous article, the approach on part of the CME Group was materially more attractive than other similar acquisition deals in the industry.Following the approval of a deal, the acquisition is expected to become effective during the second half of 2018. The CME Group and the CME Group London Limited will have to confirm the deal within 14 days after the date of the approval on part of shareholders. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: CME Group / NEXRelated News Deutsche Bank’s Risk Systems in Question After Accidental €28b Transfer  SGX Reports Strong Financials for Q3 FY2018  CME Group Discloses MoM Drop in March FX Options  Got a news tip?
