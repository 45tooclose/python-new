      A cash flow loan is a type of unsecured borrowing that is used for day-to-day operations of a small business. The loan is used to finance working capital — payments for inventory, payroll, rent, etc. — and is paid back with incoming cash flows of the business. Cash flow loans are not considered conventional bank loans, which entail more thorough credit analysis of a business. Instead, a lender makes an assessment of the cash flow generation capacity of the borrower when determining the terms of a cash flow loan.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Cash Flow Loan'
      Cash flow loans are typically sought by small companies that do not have a long credit history, significant assets to back a loan, or established track record of profitability. Because of these factors, a lender will command higher interest rates on a cash flow loan to compensate it for greater repayment risk, although in some cases, a blanket lien or personal guarantees by the signer(s) of the loan will be required as part of the debt agreement. In addition, the origination fee of a cash flow loan is higher than that of a traditional loan and is further subject to greater fees on late payments. However necessary, in the case of a small business that lacks financing options, a cash flow loan should be repaid as quickly as possible, as it represents a drain on the finances of the business.
Cash Flow Loan Example
A corner bakery is seeking $10,000 to purchase ingredients for bread, pastries and cookies, and paper packaging and boxes. With only an oven and a few furniture fixtures, the small business does not have enough assets to obtain an asset-based loan from the bank down the street. It turns to an online lender for a cash flow loan to finance the raw material inventory. As the bakery turns its products into cash over the next several weeks, it repays the $10,000 loan with interest.
