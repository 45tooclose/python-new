      A construction loan note is a short-term obligation in the form of a note, used for the funding of construction projects such as housing developments. In most cases, the note-issuers repay the note obligation by issuing a longer term bond. They then use the  proceeds from the bond to pay back the note.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Construction Loan Note '
      A construction loan note is a specific type of loan note, which appears commonly at the  municipal level: for example, a large city might use a construction loan note to finance a large civic project.
Loan Notes and Promissory Notes
Extended from one party to another, a loan note is itself a type of promissory note that enables a payee to receive payments. The payee receives payments over a set period of time, often with interest rates attached, ending with the loan paid off in its entirety. A loan note is legally binding agreement that can be drawn up by either of the contracted parties and is valid until the loan is paid in full.
A financial instrument that contains a written promise by one party (the note's issuer or maker) to pay another party (the note's payee) a definite sum of money, a promissory note contains all the terms pertaining to the debt. The promissory note, or in this case the construction loan note, will list the principal amount, interest rate, maturity date, date and place of issuance, and issuer's signature. Promissory notes occur most commonly with funding sources outside banking institutions, such as an individual or company.
A promissory note falls between an IOU and loan contract in terms of its rigidity. A promissory note includes a specific promise to pay, and the steps required to do so. A loan contract, on the other hand, states the lender’s right to recourse if the borrower defaults.
If a city experiences a boom in population, and needs to build additional housing quickly, they can begin their project quickly by issuing a construction note to the builders. This creates a quick cash flow and allows for construction to start rapidly. The city will then issue a longer term municipal bond in order to repay the construction loan note.  A municipal bond is a debt security issued by a state or municipality. Cities use municipal bonds to finance public projects and capital expenditures. These public projects can range from the city housing in the above example to the construction of highways, bridges or schools. Municipal bonds are exempt from federal taxes and most state and local taxes.
