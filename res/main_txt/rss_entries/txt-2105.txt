– RBS aims to move 1 million NatWest customers onto its new mobile bank,
– The banking giant believes it can make “significant” per-customer cost savings versus NatWest,
– A “beta” of the RBS mobile bank is on target for Q3, but it’s unclear whether this will be open to the public,
– Rather than lending, its business model will be a marketplace to help customers switch and save.
One of Britain’s largest banks, the giant £32bn Royal Bank of Scotland, is feverishly building a new mobile-only bank, which Forbes can exclusively reveal details about.
 
 
The development is in response to challenger rivals like Monzo and Revolut and is expected to be the largest new banking brand from Britain’s “big four” since HSBC launched its telebank First Direct in 1989.
As a sign of just how serious it is about the project, RBS has set an internal target of switching 1 million of its existing NatWest customers onto its mobile-only offering, a person with knowledge of the plans told Forbes.
