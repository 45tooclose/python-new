      Commercial blanket bonds are a type of liability coverage for employers who want to protect themselves against losses resulting from dishonest employees. Commercial blanket bonds provide blanket coverage for all of an employer's employees. These bonds are issued with a maximum amount that they can cover for any single loss, regardless of the number of employees involved.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Commercial Blanket Bond'
      Commercial blanket bonds, which are also known as aggregate penalty bonds, function in the same manner as position bonds in a couple of situations. Even if only one employee causes a loss, they will provide the same coverage. This also applies if the number of guilty employees cannot be determined. 
Blanket bonds cover all of a company's officers and employees for a specified amount, or they may provide broad coverage without a specific schedule of coverage. Most importantly, all new officers and employees are bonded automatically the day they are hired. If a newly hired employee commits a dishonest act that causes financial loss to the company or a customer, the employer does not have to prove that a specific employee caused the loss to collect on the insurance.
Most insurance policies would typically cover only losses incurred from external occurrences, such as burglary and property damage. This type of financial instrument can take many forms, such as a janitorial service bond or a blanket position bond that automatically covers a company's new hires. Blanket bonds provide essential coverage for companies doing business with the general public. If payment is made for a dishonest act, the bond's coverage is not reduced for subsequent dishonest acts by other covered persons.
Example of ‘Commercial Blanket Bond’
Commercial blanket bonds can vary by industry. Financial institution bonds may provide coverage for commercial and savings banks to provide coverage if an employee accepts counterfeit currency in good faith, or to cover losses from extortion if an employee is kidnapped and a ransom is demanded. Employees of government organizations who have responsibility for public funds or property may be covered in amounts that reflect each employee’s financial responsibility, however their coverage would likely be under a  fidelity bond.
Situations where a blanket bond would protect the company include, but are not limited to, trading fraud, embezzlement, material and intellectual theft, and forgery. For example, five identifiable employees as a team steal $50,000. A $10,000 blanket position bond would cover the loss in full. A $50,000 commercial blanket bond would be required to repay the insured business for the same loss.
