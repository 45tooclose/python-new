Private digital currencies are better than any state-issued version, admitted a high-ranking representative of the Swiss National Bank. Cryptocurrencies are also less risky, according to Andrea Maechler, member of the central bankâs governing board. Her comments indicate that Switzerland has no intentions to emit a state-sponsored crypto. Â

Digital Central Bank Money Brings Risks
âPrivate-sector digital currenciesâ are better and less risky than any version that might be offered by a central bank, the representative of the Swiss National Bankâs management thinks. âDigital central bank money for the general public is not necessary to ensure an efficient system for cashless retail paymentsâ, Andrea Maechler said during an event in Zurich. She went on to explain why a crypto issued by a central bank could increase the risk of bank runs.
A government-backed cryptocurrency would make it easier for people to transfer money out of their accounts, if they felt a bank was in difficulties. âIt would deliver scarcely any advantages, but would give rise to incalculable risks with regard to financial stability,â Maechler said, quoted by Reuters. In her option, a state-issued cryptocurrency would be calling into question the âtried and tested two-tier systemâ in which the SNB acts as a bank to commercial banks, which in turn deal with end customers.
Not all of Mrs. Maechlerâs remarks were positive about cryptos. She thinks âcryptocurrencies are not true competitors to conventional currenciesâ, despite the soaring interest in bitcoin. The hype has outweighed their actual use, the banker says. SNBâs representative also pointed out that money must be a viable medium of exchange, a stable unit of account and a long-term store of value â functions that, in her words, cryptos donât perform. Digital coins are also highly volatile, and a speculative investment instrument rather than a means of payment, she added.
However, neither the unexpected recognition of cryptos, nor the usual talking points against them, are what makes Andrea Maechlerâs speech important. What deserves attention is the indication that the central bank and the government of Switzerland have no immediate plans, or even desire, to launch a state-sponsored cryptocurrency.
Cryptos Have What Swiss Banks Used to Offer
With an âe-francâ project, Bern could join a club of governments tempted to control at least one âcryptoâ. The leader in this competition, Venezuela, became the first country with a state-issued digital coin. The âoil-backedâ petro comes to partially replace the hyperinflated fiat bolivar. Russia has been mulling over a cryptoruble but the idea has been put on the backburner for now. Its central bank thinks it is ânot appropriateâ, and the finance ministry informed Putin a centralized crypto is not even possible. Sweden has been thinking about an âe-kronaâ, and Poland is reportedly developing an âe-zÅotyâ.
Switzerland, however, has never been eager to join clubs of any kind, it takes pride in its independence. Swiss banking practices have been a good example of that for many years, before pressures from tax authorities, both American and European, increased. The attitude towards cryptocurrencies may become another proof of Switzerlandâs independence.
The Alpine confederation is already regarded as a crypto-friendly jurisdiction, where many crypto businesses are headquartered or represented. It has become one of the first countries to establish a crypto valley, in the Canton of Zug. The Chinese mining giant Bitmain opened a branch there, and one of Russiaâs largest banks, Gazprombank, announced plans to test cryptocurrency deals in Switzerland.
Decentralized, unregulated cryptocurrencies offer what the country provided to Swiss bank account holders for a very long time â security and anonymity. Sometimes it looks as if Switzerland is wondering whether it can do it again in a crypto environment.
