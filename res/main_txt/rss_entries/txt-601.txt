            A company tied to Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian caterer nicknamed “Putin’s chef” because of his close ties to President Vladimir Putin, has hired a lawyer to defend U.S. charges that it joined in a long-running scheme to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.The company, Concord Management and Consulting LLC, has retained Washington lawyer Eric Dubelier, according to a court filing in the case, which was brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.Since Mueller announced a sweeping indictment in mid-February against 13 Russian individuals and three companies, there’s been no activity in the case and it was expected that no one would appear to defend the charges.
