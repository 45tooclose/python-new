There are a select few business leaders and innovators who are changing the world.
In our Boss It Like series, we ask leaders like Slack CTO Cal Henderson, European Managing Director at WeWork Eugen Miropolski, and Clue period app CEO Ida Tin, how they get so much done in such an impossibly short amount of time.
Today we meet CÃ©line Lazorthes, the FinTech founder who's shifting billions of euros across Europe through her companies Leetchi and MangoPay (acquired by French banking group CrÃ©dit Mutuel ArkÃ©a).
A busy woman, with big ideas, Forbes asks Lazorthes how she gets it all done...

Early bird? Or Night owl?
Iâm a mix of both an early bird and a night owl, depending on the day. However, each morning I start at 8a.m. with a big breakfast and the latest news review on French media: Le Monde, Le Figaro, Frenchweb etc.
On top of that, I briefly browse through trending stories on social media: Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.
I tend to start checking my emails and Slack notifications on my way to work so that I'm on top of all business needs and I can be productive the minute I enter my office.

What smartphone do you have?
I have an iPhone 7 in metal pink, with a pink case. Yes, I know 100% girlie!
What productivity apps or methods do you use to be more productive?
I give myself a daily target to focus on, a little "To Do" list.
If I'm working on a task or project that requires 100% of my attention, I cut myself off from all the disruptions around. I turn Slack notifications, incoming emails and phone calls off, I put my headphones on and play my favorite music for getting work done (the Goldberg Variations by Johann Sebastian Bach, and Norah Jones' Come Away with Me).
I also practice sport two to three time a week: I do different types of yoga as well as go to the gym, and I try to be as rigorous with my schedule as possible to develop good habits.
I believe that regular physical activity along with meditation is the best way to unwind and get ready to tackle another day with new challenges.
As for apps, I can't live without: Buddhify and Calm (meditation apps), Slack (helps me stay in touch with employees in 4 different countries).
How many people, outside of family, do you meet in a day?
It's hard to say, as I tend to meet with many different types of people throughout the day!
On my agenda you can find meetings scheduled with my workmates, journalists, other entrepreneurs, people from the startup and FinTech ecosystems as well as students.
I know it's a lot to handle in one day, but I try to efficiently allocate my time as these encounters are a source of inspiration for me!

    Lazorthes recommends The Unbearable lightness of Being . 
    
   
  

What book have you read, either recently or in the past, that has inspired you?
The book that has marked me the most, and the one I keep on bedside table, is The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera.
Kundera argues that Nietzsche's concept of "eternal return" is a false premise. The story of four protagonists in this book teaches us that we're free to make choices and need to learn to love our fate. We have only one life and we must seize all the opportunities as they come only once.
âOur dreams prove that to imagine - to dream about things that have not happened - is among mankindâs deepest needs,â says Kundera.
I'm currently also reading Immortelle RandonnÃ©e (Immortal Trek) by Jean-Christophe Rufin.
This book talks about author's experience and connection with the Spanish pilgrimage tracks, called le Chemin de Saint Jacques de Compostelle. I find it interesting because I plan to embark on a very similar journey in the near future and the book is full of advice and reflection on life.
