      A pure yield pickup swap is a transaction in which bonds with lower returns and shorter maturity rates are swapped for bonds with higher returns and longer maturity timeframes. The investor is swapping the lower yield bond for a bond that will give higher yields.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Pure Yield Pickup Swap'
      With a pure yield pickup swap the sole purpose of the transaction is to increase yield, the new bonds will have a similar maturity and risk rating as the old bonds; only the coupon will differ. Investors are using one bond to purchase another bond that will yield you more money. For example, an investor can sell a bond with a low yield and then use the profits from that yield to purchase a bond with a higher yield.
Bonds earn yields for investors in three primary ways: coupon interest, capital gains and coupon reinvestment. Investors can use different types of bond swaps to take advantage of these different types of yields to try to improve their returns. Other examples of bond swaps include a rate anticipation swap, which is carried out with the goal of earning a better return from an expected change in market interest rates; a substitution swap, which exchanges two bonds that are similar in every way except price; and intermarket spread swaps, which seek to profit from yield mismatches.
Limitations of a pure yield pickup swap
While a pure yield pickup swap sounds like a simple and straightforward to make more money by simply exchanging more pricey bonds that don’t yield as high of return for less expensive, higher yield bonds, there are some considerations that need to be made. For instance, any bond that is less expensive and has a higher yield return generally also carries a higher risk for investors too.
In a pure yield pickup swap, the investor who has the lower yield bond has the highest amount of risk because the higher yield bond usually will be a lower credit quality. Additionally, the longer maturity rate of the new, high-yield bond means the bondholder now has a higher amount of interest rate risk. More time to mature means more time and opportunity for interest rates to change unfavorably. In general, a bond’s price will drop when interest rates rise.
