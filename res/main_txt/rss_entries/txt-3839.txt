Meanwhile, those players who remain bullish about Japan’s future as a crypto trading hub continue to make strides in the regulatory sphere.Last week, it was announced that a combined effort to create a self-regulatory body had finally got off the ground in the form of the Japanese Cryptocurrency Exchange Association (JCEA).According to chairman Taizen Okuyama, who is also president and CEO of forex firm Money Partners, the cross-industry body will offer assistance to exchanges which have so far been unable to comply with the FSA.“I would like to create a situation where I can give advice to [unlicensed exchanges] – the development of the industry as a whole is important,” he told local news outlet Asahi Shimbun April 24.What do you think about the potential for certain altcoins to be dropped from Japanese exchanges?
