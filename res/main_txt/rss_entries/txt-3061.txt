The Altair 8800 was arguably the first microcomputer that kicked off the computer revolution, and with it came Altair Basic, a licensed version of Microsoft Basic. Microsoft Basic was the company's first licensed commercial product, as it licensed various versions to Apple Computers (NASDAQ: AAPL), Commodore and IBM (NYSE: IBM). Sales for the company were $16,005 in 1976.
The iconic tipping point came when IBM was planning to launch a personal computer but lacked an operating system. While Microsoft did not have an operating system, Bill Gates successfully bluffed IBM to win the contract on Aug. 12, 1981. Rather than program one from scratch, Gates negotiated a deal to purchase the 86-DOS product from Seattle Computer Products for less than $100,000 and licensed it to IBM for a royalty fee on every PC it would produce. The IBM PC launch turned out to be an unprecedented success, catapulting Microsoft's sales to $55 million in 1983. Microsoft launched the first iteration of its Windows franchise in 1985.
The company went public in 1986 at $21 per share. Since then, Microsoft has grown to revenue of $89.9 billion in 2017, through 121 subsidiaries in over 810 locations, with more than 112,000 employees worldwide. Microsoft's most popular brands include Windows, Office 365, Bing, MSN, Skype, Exchange and cloud applications Azure, SQL Server and .NET. Microsoft is a component in the big three benchmark indexes: Dow Jones Industrial Average index, Standard and Poor's 500 (S&P 500) index, and the Nasdaq-100 index.
