While last week was a bad one for Facebook and social media in general, there is little argument that both will recover quickly, whatever the hashtagers proclaim. 
For many people, Facebook IS the internet and the hand-wringing about connected apps stealing data is effete. It was obvious this was the case, but people on computers have always wanted things too quickly. 
They just pressed and linked, then they were burnt; maybe now they might think. Never has the proverb ‘Look before you leap’ been more apposite. 
But while Facebook will be resilient, democracy has had more than a bad week. It has had a bad time for the last couple of years and that recovery may be more complicated than the CEO of a social media channel finally saying sorry. 
Democracy is being undermined by kleptocracy, gerontocracy and technocracy. According to recent data from MIT, fake news spreads six times faster than the truth on Twitter. Great 'news' for any budding dictators just starting out. 
 
  
Whether it is algorithms, content farms, malevolence or stupidity, the notion of fair voting for a party is being superseded by cults and individuals. These chancers have noticed a weakness and are exploiting it, but who will rid us of these turbulent beasts? 
Many are trying to redress the balance. Some are even suggesting we go back to paper and pen. Other countries, such as India, have finally noticed that even its Electronic Voting Machines (introduced in 1999) may be deficient. 
 
Perhaps, like most things in the universe that is currently forming, it will be the blockchain that will save democracy. Politics may embody decentralization at its zenith.
