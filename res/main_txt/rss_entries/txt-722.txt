            Brexit Secretary David Davis speaks on Thursday, with a lot of questions to answer about the progress of talks with the European Union. There’s still no sign of any formal negotiations on what the post-Brexit trading relationship, even though three weeks have passed since the summit that was meant to herald the start of those talks.Discussions have focused on the issue of the Irish border, with no easy solution in sight. And inside the British government, there’s still no consensus about what the future relationship with the EU should look like. Eurasia Group now reckons the U.K. will end up staying in a customs union with the bloc, a view that chimes with what parts of the government want.Davis: No Precedent for Customs Deal U.K. Seeks (9:27 a.m.)Davis says leaving the EU customs union was one of the big upsides of Brexit, giving Britain “the ability to strike free-trade deals elsewhere.” But that said, the secretary says the U.K. does want a customs deal -- just not one for which there is any precedent.

We are still going to be the biggest and most important financial center in the world in five years, in 10 years," he says.Davis: Parliament Won’t Accept Deal Without Details (9:18 a.m.)Davis says that Parliament won’t sign off on the exit deal unless there’s a lot of detail about the future relationship. EU officials say the agreement on the future relationship is likely to be pretty vague.
