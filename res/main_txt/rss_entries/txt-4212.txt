      Retrocession refers to kickbacks, trailer, or finders fees that are paid to advisers or distributors from asset managers. These payments are often not disclosed to clients although they use client money. Retrocession commission is a fee-sharing arrangement that is criticized because money is given back to marketers for their efforts in raising money for a product. Therefore, this type of system encourages advisers to promote funds or products because they will receive a fee, not because the funds are the best option for the client.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Retrocession'
      
Retrocession fees are commissions paid to a wealth manager or other new money acquirer by a third party. For example, banks often pay retrocession fees to wealth managers who partner with them and encourage and compensate them for providing business in the form of a wealth management assignment. Banks may also receive retrocession fees from third parties, such as investment funds, for distributing specific financial products.
Some consider retrocession fees to be a dubious compensation model because they can influence a bank or wealth manager’s decision to recommend products, which may not be in the best interest of their clients.
Types of Retrocession
Retrocession fees typically refer to recurring kickbacks. A one-off compensation is typically called a finder’s fee, referral fee, or acquisition commission. There are three types of retrocession fees:
Custody banking retrocession fees. In this case, a wealth manager receives compensation for attracting a new customer and that customer's investment to a custody bank. With frequent changes in service providers, a wealth manager can generate retrocession fees that benefit their own interests but not those of their customer.
Trading retrocession fees. Trading retrocession fees are paid as compensation for various trading transactions such as securities trading. The more transactions that occur, the higher the retrocession fees paid out and the higher the brokerage fees the customer must pay.
Financial product purchase retrocession fees. In finance, retrocession fees are often attached to investment funds. Part of the recurring total expense ratio, which customers must pay, goes back to the customer acquirer in the form of retrocession fees. Because the total expense ratio is charged to the customer each year, the acquirer receives retrocession fees every year in the form of recurring commissions.
The JP Morgan Case
In 2015, JP Morgan settled a case with the SEC for $267 million. The SEC stated that JP Morgan selected third-party hedge funds based on hedge fund managers' willingness to provide 1 percent in fees to a bank affiliate, and the bank did not to inform clients that it preferred funds willing to share their fees. According to Forbes, the JP Morgan settlement represented the first time U.S. investors were introduced to the term “retrocession.”
