LTC is the least correlated of the major altcoin markets, having spent the majority of 2018 channeling within a 30% when paired against BTC.

Cardano, Stellar, and IOTA Double During April
The price of Cardano has nearly doubled during April, with the ADA markets rallying from a low of $0.145 two weeks ago to now be testing resistance at $0.285.

Altcoins Are Back?
Although the cryptocurrency markets have produced impressive performance during April, whether or not the markets can sustain the bullish momentum in the medium term remains to be seen.
With so many altcoin markets breaking above descending triangles and rallying to test the 0.236% fibonacci retracement areas, many analysts are waiting for the markets to pull back and produce a higher low on larger time frame charts before proclaiming that the first altcoin season of 2018 is indeed kicking off.
