The Japanese corporation, which was formed in 2013, operates the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Osaka Securities Exchange.Last year saw significant growth for the firm. Operating revenue increased year on year by 11.9 percent from 107.88 billion yen ($0.99 billion) to 121.71 billion yen ($1.10 billion). The firm’s operating income grew by over 20 percent in the past year, from 59.38 billion yen ($0.54 billion) in 2017 to 71.8 billion yen ($0.66 billion) this year.Net income for the firm also increased significantly. While 2017 saw the firm finish the year with 42.36 billion yen ($0.39 billion), this year the firm earned 50.63 billion yen ($0.46 billion) in net income – close to 20 percent year on year growth.This was accompanied by income before income tax year on year growth of over 20 percent. The firm earned 60.60 billion yen ($0.55 billion) in pre-income tax earnings in 2017 but finished this year with 72.99 billion yen ($0.67 billion).The firm’s financial results report noted that the firm’s growth was mainly due to increases in trading and clearing services revenue. Transaction fees played a large role in this, increasing by 16.2 percent year on year, from 36.52 billion yen ($0.33 billion) to 42.30 billion yen ($0.39 billion).The report will come as a relief to both investors and people within the firm.
