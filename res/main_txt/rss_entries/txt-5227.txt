            President Vladimir Putin faced boisterous protests two days before his inauguration for a record fourth term as Russians across the country took to the streets to denounce his nearly two decades of rule.Opposition leader Alexey Navalny was detained at the Moscow protest, Interfax reported, as police warned they would use force to break up the unsanctioned demonstrations. His organization planned rallies in about 90 cities against corruption and censorship under the slogan “He’s not our Tsar.” Protesters used social media to share photographs from other meetings, while the OVD Info monitoring group said more than 200 people were detained.Putin, 65, won a record 77 percent of the vote in March’s election, amid complaints from critics of ballot stuffing and an absence of genuine competition. But with neighboring Armenia offering an example of the potential threat from street protests, Russian authorities aren’t taking any chances.

        The prosecutor’s office for central Moscow warned that Navalny and any other participants would “face the consequences under the law of the Russian Federation,” according to a website statement.ProtestsIn Moscow, protesters mingled with hundreds of Putin supporters chanting "Russia, Russia" and wearing ribbons associated with the May 9 Victory Day celebration, a holiday when tanks and troops parade on Red Square in a display of Russian military might to commemorate the end of World War II.Riot police were targeting Navalny supporters carrying anti-Putin signs, detaining people from the crowd one-by-one. Protesters chanted "Putin is a thief" and other anti-government slogans.The unrest Saturday comes less than a week after tens of thousands protested on May 1 against restrictions on the internet after the authorities started trying to block the popular Telegram messaging messaging app. Navalny addressed that rally in Moscow.Putin faces mounting challenges as stagnant growth steadily eats away at living standards and the government braces for unpopular belt-tightening measures such as increasing the pension age. He’s also locked in a standoff with the West that’s provoked increasingly painful sanctions and must decide how to settle the issue of succession when his final term allowed under the Constitution ends in 2024.

        Navalny, who was barred from challenging Putin in the presidential vote, has lost momentum since last year, when he staged the biggest protests since those provoked by alleged ballot-rigging in 2011-2012.The 41-year-old opposition leader and anti-corruption activist, who almost managed to force a run-off against a Putin ally in Moscow’s mayoral elections in 2013, is counting on an upsurge in social dissatisfaction to erode support for Putin and the ruling system in the years ahead.“Navalny is very far-sighted, he is waiting patiently for the opportunity to exploit popular dissatisfaction,” said Alexei Makarkin, an analyst at the Moscow-based Center for Political Technologies.
