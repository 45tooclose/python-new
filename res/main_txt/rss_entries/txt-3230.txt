The Ripple share of the total market capitalization increased by more than 100 percent from 3.56 percent to 7.57 percent.The XRP market volume share also grew from 5.3 percent to 6.9 percent.

The extension of over $16 million worth of XRP loans to market makers also contributed to the increase in the XRP volume share.XRP Price and Volume Performance for Q1 2018Effects of Regulatory Measures on PerformanceThe report also touched on the regulatory upheavals that characterized the end of 2017 and the start of 2018.
