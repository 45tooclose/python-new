            Czech billionaire Prime Minister Andrej Babis said he will try to resume government talks with Social Democrats, snubbing a recommendation from the country’s president that he should seek backing from two extreme parties.The leadership of Babis’s ANO party decided to approach the Social Democrats again, he said on Twitter late on Thursday.

President Milos Zeman advised Babis earlier this week to negotiate a tacit support for his minority cabinet with the Communists and the far-right SPD party.Read more: Billionaire’s Quest for Power Stress Tests Czech Democracy

        ANO’s decision comes after several of its lawmakers and cabinet members objected to relying on backing from parties that seek to take the central European country of 10.6 million out of the NATO military alliance. The anti-Muslim SPD also calls for the Czech Republic to leave the Europe Union.Babis, the second-richest Czech, is now ruling in a caretaker role after his first single-party administration failed to win parliamentary approval in a confidence vote in January.
