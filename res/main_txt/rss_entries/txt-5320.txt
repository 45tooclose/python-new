Williams Martini Racing, one of the world’s leading Formula One teams, is known for its relentless innovation, and the motorsport team relies heavily on technology to gain an edge on its rivals. Now, the team has announced that it is looking at blockchain technology to help deliver a competitive advantage.
Williams has won 16 FIA Formula One World Championships and scored 114 victories since it was founded by Frank Williams in 1977. With a global following, more than a billion people tune into Formula One races.
The team is now investigating how it can use blockchain technology, and has partnered with enterprise middleware technology provider Omnitude to explore how blockchain could be implemented across the team’s operations in a demanding data-driven environment.
Williams Martini Racing has signed a multi-year partnership with Omnitude to explore the potential applications of blockchain in the team’s everyday business, from supply chain provence to merchandising.

Speaking about the partnership with Omnitude, Claire Williams, Deputy Team Principal of Williams Martini Racing, said: “
Williams prides itself on speed of innovation and engineering excellence. We welcome the opportunity to form a close partnership with Omnitude and provide the ideal environment to showcase radical new technologies that have the power to transform the capabilities of businesses around the world.”
Omnitude brings connectivity between blockchain technologies and enterprise systems making it “easier, quicker and cheaper” for companies of all sizes to embrace Blockchain, paving the way for the technology to be adopted on a mass scale. Omnitude’s smart integration layer allows enterprises to adopt blockchain on a “plug and play” basis, without needing to replace existing systems.
Commenting on the collaboration, Chris Painter, CEO and Founder of Omnitude, said:
“We are exceptionally pleased to have signed this deal with Williams, to look at how Omnitude’s expertise in blockchain technologies can be implemented across their organisation. Working with Williams Martini Racing is a major validation of our product and vision and this partnership is a natural pairing of two of the UK’s most innovative and cutting edge organisations.”
In addition to trials of blockchain technology, the partnership will see Omnitude’s branding on the team’s drivers and senior personnel from the Spanish Grand Prix. The company’s logo will also appear on the team environment over a race weekend and on the car for the Spanish and Monaco Grand Prix.
Williams is the first F1 team to announce its use of blockchain technology, though last year, Jetcoin became the main sponsor of Sky Grande Prix during Singapore’s Formula 1 night race.
