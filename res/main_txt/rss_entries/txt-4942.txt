JPMorgan Files a Patent for Interbank Blockchain Payment Network The patent, which was published on May 3rd, was originally filed in October of 2017.

The patent compared blockchain with present practices: “for a cross-border payment to be made from a payment organization to a payment beneficiary [at present], a number of messages must be sent between the banks and clearing houses involved in processing the transaction.”“This often results in a slow transaction,” the filing continued, “as there may be delays in service due to correspondent banking, messaging networks, and clearing intermediaries in the payment flow.”JPMorgan has recently been particularly active in its engagements with blockchain technology. The company was considering establishing “Quorum” blockchain network as its own legal entity earlier this year. Just yesterday, Finance Magnates exclusively reported that JPMorgan is working on developing a blockchain system for trading debts internally.If successful, the system will expand from the company’s commercial bank to other “sub-banks”; the system could also act as a sort of test for a blockchain network that customers would interact with directly. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: blockchain / blockchain companies / blockchain technology / crypto / Jpmorgan / JPMorgan ChaseRelated News Revolut Adds Bitcoin Cash and Ripple Trading, Raises $250 Million  France Outlines Significant Tax Cut for Cryptocurrency  How Blockchain Can Make the Online Gambling Industry a Safer Place  Got a news tip?
