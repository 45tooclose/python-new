  VRBex, a U.S.-based company founded by financial experts dedicated to building a cryptocurrency exchange and security-token trading platform compliant with regulatory requirements, has announced an initial security token offering (ISTO) for potential backers.
CEO Gene Grant and COO David Powell see the token holders as ardent supporters and future customers of VRBex’s reliable cryptocurrency and security token exchange platform. The project is designed to survive the trials and tribulations of a competitive and highly regulated financial services universe.
VRBex is the creation of professionals from the traditional financial markets, where participants are accustomed to a stringently regulated environment. The new venture seeks to become a trusted and efficient provider of a wide range of services related to digital assets, examples being trading, exchange, payment, and storage.

Initially, the VRBex platform will provide two-way exchange services for U.S. dollar against some of the most popular cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ether, and Bitcoin Cash), a mechanism for security tokens trading, and digital VRBex wallets where users can keep both fiat currencies and digital assets. All services are subject to proper licensing, custody regulations, and other requirements.

"Once the cryptocurrency market value exceeded $750 billion it represented the emergence of a new financial asset class," Grant said. "This is a powerful and clear confirmation that cryptocurrencies are viable. The seven-person VRBex management team brings more than 200 years' combined experience working in highly regulated environments. Building financial services business, and adapting to ongoing regulatory and compliance changes, have been key components of our professional careers."
"VRBex is purpose-built to help investors navigate the fast-moving world of cryptocurrencies and security tokens, and we welcome sound regulatory oversight because it brings confidence to the market," Powell added. "As more mainstream customers enter this marketplace, the importance of investor protections and financial security will increase. The sheer scale of the market cries out for the protections and lessons learned from our many years of experience in the traditional financial markets."

The VRBex team has extensive experience in dealing with risk-remediation and complex regulatory requirements for the traditional financial sector.
VRBex pre-sale details
There will be about 135 million VRBex security tokens available for purchase with Bitcoin, Ether, U.S. dollars or euros. The company seeks full compliance with the laws and regulations of the United States and any other applicable jurisdictions and invites investors that meet the suitability standards to register for the token pre-sale at VRBex.io. They will receive 30 days of commission-free trading activity on the VRBex platform when it goes live.
The VRBex token offering will be carried out in two separate phases. A pre-sale open to selected investors starts on April 23 and ends on June 18, with VRBex reserving the right to extend or terminate the pre-sale at its sole discretion. The main sale is expected to commence on June 18 and run through July 23.
