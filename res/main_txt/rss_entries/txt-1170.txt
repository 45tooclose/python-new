Bitcoin in Brief today is slanted toward a crypto winter slowly thawing, as Pantera Capital bets on a moonshot price point. Also, the worldâs most popular decentralized digital asset has been forked more than a plate of good pasta; thereâs a growing list of countries whoâre less likely to nab your crypto profits; Yahoo! smashes rumors; and a good-hearted wager between bitcoin core and bitcoin cash partisans exemplifies how ecosystem actors should treat one another.

A Pantherâs Moonshot 
Bulls have a panther as their advocate to help thaw this crypto winter. We reported this week, âPantera Capital, an investment firm exclusively operating in the cryptocurrency and distributed ledger technology sectors, has published a letter predicting that bitcoin has established the low for its current bear market. Pantera cites a number of factors as informing its market outlook.â

Among those factors are taxes on capital gains, where estimates are in the many, many billions expected from enthusiasts. That in turn, the fund theorizes, dragged prices down, and bitcoin core has found a bottom at $6,500, as holders were forced to sell in order to pay government bills. We continue, âPantera also states that âItâs highly likelyâ for the price of bitcoin to exceed its previous record highs of $20,000 âwithin a year,â asserting that âA wall of institutional money will driveâ the growth in price.â
Speaking of Taxes
Until that prediction comes true, readers should pack their bags to save money from the tax man! Start looking for places to stay in Germany, Slovenia, Denmark, Belarus, South Korea, Singapore, as they’re some of the most advantageous.

We stressed how many âjurisdictions have yet to update their tax laws to encompass cryptocurrencies. Rules governing taxation are often incoherent and very different even in countries that are part of a common space. In the European Union, for instance, tax rates in member-states vary between 0 and 50%.â
Forking Crazy
Be honest. Youâve never heard of Bitcoin Minor, Bitcoin King, nor Bitcoin Boy. How many times would you guess the Bitcoin network has been forked? During an extensive and really interesting investigation, we revealed nearly 70 times. Thatâs right, 70.
We summarized findings as how forking âbitcoin used to be a rarity. Then it became the norm. And then it became a meme, with anyone and everyone forking bitcoin on a weekly basis. There have now been a total of 69 bitcoin forks plus another 18 altcoin forks. Holders of bitcoin, monero, ethereum, and litecoin can claim almost 80 additional coins for free. Whether itâs worth their time to do so, however, is another matter.â
The Fork of All Forks Remains a Solid Option
The most famous of forks is, of course, bitcoin cash (BCH). Its being faster, sleeker, younger, and bigger (block wise) has lead those on the bitcoin core (BTC) side to take a stance on BCHâs long term viability. And while each side feels passionate about its coin, and the future that it entails, debate often become rancorous, turning everyone off.
A reader responds to a hilarious bet.
We reported how two well-known advocates joked and ribbed one another about Coreâs anticipated Lightning Network solution. They bet bragging rights if a demonstration of the solution failed a basic transaction. Loser would have to wear a t-shirt of the winnerâs coin. Regardless of which won, the import is how the two men exchanged laughs and good humor, and the ecosystem needs more of both.
Japan Continues to Lead
No laughing matter is how the crypto winter continues its thaw as âYahoo! Japan has confirmed that it is entering the crypto space by acquiring a stake in a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange that is already licensed by the countryâs financial regulator. The company plans to launch a crypto exchange in the fall of this year,â we explained.

Thanks to our readers liking and sharing, our post on aspects of Islam possibly opening to cryptocurrency was picked up and republished and referenced around the world. Some contend it was the root cause of bitcoinâs recent price rebound. Great job, gang.
