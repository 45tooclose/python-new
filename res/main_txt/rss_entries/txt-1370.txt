IFSC Flags Binary Options Broker, Bitcoin Mining Firm Over False Licenses The ‎Belize regulator has recently stepped up its fight against ‎binary options ‎brokers. ‎    Aziz Abdel-Qader  |  Regulation ( Binary Options )  |   Tuesday, 17/04/2018 | 20:43 GMT   Photo: ReutersShare this articleThe International Financial Services Commission of Belize (IFSC) ‎today ‎issued a warning stating that a company calling itself BTCHOME Mining is ‎falsely claiming to hold International Business Company registration in ‎Belize.‎BTCHOME claims to operate a regulated ECN/STP Forex brokerage service ‎that provide trading facilities to clients globally with an additional ‎focus on cryptocurrency mining. The fraudulent firm says it allows traders to ‎achieve more profits through reinvesting their funds in its cloud mining service ‎which offers an alternative to those who would like to engage in altcoin ‎mining activities.‎Get free trading education!In order to prevent such fraudulent practices, IFSC has ‎issued several guidelines which encourage potential ‎investors to be wary of promises of disproportionate ‎returns. A guaranteed investment with a high return that ‎considerably exceeds the market return is often too good ‎to be true, it says.‎The ‎Belize regulator has also stepped up its fight against ‎binary options brokers. The latest addition to its blacklist ‎was ‘Matrix-Option,’ which operates through ‎https://www.matrixoption.com, and has been ‎cited today ‎for forgery over its ‎regulatory status. ‎According to the Belize’s IFSC, ‎‎all persons concerned ‎should exercise extreme caution and take note, as the ‎‎‎aforementioned entity is also fraudulently claiming to hold ‎a trading licence in financial and commodity-based ‎derivative instruments and other securities licence.‎Typically, alleged scam entities in scenarios like this may ‎deny the accusations and make ‎up excuses, perhaps that it ‎was an administrative error, but in this case the company ‎‎plus listing on its website the regulatory status, it also ‎‎provides a link to a copy of its alleged IFSC license. ‎Specifically, the IFSC warned that the company is posting on its website a ‎Certificate of Incorporation No: IFSC/60/310/IME/16-344 carrying its name ‎and purporting to be incorporated in Belize, yet this certificate is a “complete ‎forgery,” the watchdog says. ‎ googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: Belize / Mining / WarningRelated News Exclusive: O-SYSTEMS Acquired by Hong Kong-Based Company  Daniel Lawrance Leaves Destek Markets UK for Scope Markets  Got a news tip?
