            Donald Trump resumed a full-throated attack on James Comey, hours before the FBI director he fired in May will appear in a network television interview ahead of the release of a book that describes the president in unfavorable terms.“I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His ‘memos’ are self serving and FAKE!” Trump tweeted early Sunday, his fourth Comey-related tweet of the morning.#lazy-img-326546831:before{padding-top:67.81818181818181%;}James Comey’s new bookPhotographer: Bebeto Matthews/AP PhotosTrump’s tweet storm comes ahead of a highly anticipated interview with Comey on ABC News to be broadcast on Sunday night.

        Comey, who ran the Federal Bureau of Investigation for almost four years, portrays the president in the book as a liar, dumb and rude, and he compares elements of Trump’s behavior to that of a Mafia boss.The Republican National Committee has started an effort to discredit Comey on social media, in digital advertising, and through a website, lyincomey.com, ahead of the release of the book. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday that Comey has a “credibility problem” and that firing him will go down as one of Trump’s greatest achievements.House Speaker Paul Ryan said Sunday that Comey is a man of integrity “as far as I know,” while adding that “I don’t know the guy.”Asked if Comey is someone he would describe as a slime ball -- a term Trump has used twice in tweets this week -- Ryan said in an interview broadcast Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that “I don’t speak like that. I don’t use words like that.”
