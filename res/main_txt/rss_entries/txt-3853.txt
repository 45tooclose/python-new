      BREAKING DOWN 'North Sea Brent Crude'
      North Sea Brent crude contains a blend of oils recovered from the oilfield systems in the North Sea, including the Brent, Forties, Oseberg, Ekofisk and Ninian systems. The first oil system supplying North Sea Brent crude was discovered in the early 1960s and extracted from the Brent field by Shell UK. At the time, Shell named its oilfields after birds, so the name Brent derives from the brent goose. It also serves as an acronym for the formations that make up the main field: Broom, Rannoch, Etive, Ness and Tarbert.
Brent crude oil has relatively low sulfur content and a relatively high gravity on the American Petroleum Instituteâ€™s standard scale. This categorizes the crude as both light, due to its low viscosity, and sweet, due to its low sulfur content. Among other major benchmark crudes, only West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, oil is sweeter and lighter.
Light sweet crudes are easier to process into products such as gasoline because they contain a higher proportion of hydrocarbon molecules than other oils. Therefore, they tend to fetch higher prices on commodity markets.
Over a dozen wells now produce the component grades that wind up in North Sea Brent Crude. Those wells primarily come from North Sea plays controlled by the United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany.
Investing in North Sea Brent crude
Since the oil crisis of the late 1970s, the vast majority of crude oil commodity sales have taken place on the futures market. Brent futures are available on the Intercontinental Exchange in Europe as well as the New York Mercantile Exchange. Options linked to the North Sea Brent crude benchmark are also widely available.
Investors typically trade Brent-related commodity contracts either as a hedge or on a speculative basis. Those taking hedge positions include companies that produce and market crude oil, as well as refineries or other entities that process the oil. Hedging strategies for firms in fuel-dependent industries, such as airlines, may also take advantage of Brent-related contracts.
For example, some hedging strategies involve trading on crack spreads related to Brent, in which traders take simultaneous long and short positions in Brent crude and finished products that use Brent crude as a raw material. In order for these types of trades to pay off, the price differential between the raw materials and the finished goods must widen over time. This type of contract might appeal to an oil refinery seeking to protect its profit margin from price volatility in the crude oil market.
