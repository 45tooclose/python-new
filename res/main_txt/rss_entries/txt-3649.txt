      The Treasury index is an index based on the auctions of U.S. Treasury bills, or on the U.S. Treasury's daily yield curve. Financial institutions often base mortgage rates on the U.S. Treasury index because it shows the rate of return investors could likely receive from another bank.

      Breaking Down 'Treasury Index'
      The U.S. government sells debt instruments such as Treasury bills, Treasury notes and Treasury bonds through the U.S. Treasury to raise money for capital projects such as new infrastructure. The various debt instruments sold by the U.S. Treasury come with different maturities of up to 30 years. Treasury bills are short-term bonds that mature within a year, while the Treasury notes have maturity dates of 10 years or less. The longest-term instruments are Treasury bonds, which offer maturities of 20 and 30 years.
Just like other bonds, Treasuries have an inverse relationship between price and yield, meaning when the price is higher, the yield is lower. The Treasury index is based on the U.S. Treasury’s daily yield curve, or the curve that shows the Treasury’s return on investment on the U.S. government’s debt obligations. Treasury yield determines the interest rate at which the U.S. government borrows money for various lengths of time. The Treasury yield also affects how much investors earn when they invest in this debt as well as they interest rates people and companies pay on loans for purchases such as cars and real estate.
The Treasury yield curve is an expression of how investors feel about the economic environment. When yields are higher on long-term Treasuries, the economic outlook is more positive. Interest rates increase when the Treasury yield increases because this causes the government to pay increased interest rates to draw interest from buyers in future auction.
How The Treasury Index Is Used
The U.S. Treasury index influences other types of securities and helps illustrate how much risk investors are willing to take. Components of a treasury index are likely to be the weighted average prices of five-year, 10-year and bond-futures contracts. Because the components have different investment time frames, each weighting is adjusted for equal contribution to the index.
Lenders often use the index to determine mortgage rates for mortgages with an unfixed component and as a performance benchmark for investors in the capital markets because it represents a rate of return that investors would be able to get from almost any bank, with minimal effort. The calculations of treasury indexes and their components vary by the financial institution calculating the index.
