            Brexit Secretary David Davis gives evidence to parliamentary committee Wednesday, with the future of the Northern Ireland border and the increasingly fractious debate over whether the U.K. should remain in a customs union with the European Union likely to dominate.Davis speaks ahead of a meeting of Prime Minister Theresa May’s so-called Brexit war cabinet this afternoon. She’s under growing pressure to stay in the customs union, with business and probably a majority of Parliament in favor. The question is how the pro-Brexit members of Cabinet will respond if she does -- so far at least, none has publicly threatened to resign.Davis Says No Deal With EU on Brexit Is Unlikely (9:57 a.m.)“The complete absence of any outcome is unlikely,” Davis says. “You might end up with a bare-bones deal --- or a whole series of bilateral deals. I don’t think no deal is a significant probability at all.”Davis Says Huge Advantages Outside Customs Union (9:43 a.m.)

        Davis doesn’t say how the government would react if Parliament defeats it on the customs union issue, but he does stick to the long-held line about the advantages for the U.K. of leaving it -- ability to negotiate own trade deals etc. He also dismisses the idea that it will be a significant practical impediment to trade.“If you have no tariffs, if you have no quotas, if you have mutual recognition of standards, why would you have a high friction border?” he asks.Davis: Ireland Solution Not Needed Until Dec. 2020 (9:35 a.m.)Davis says that given there’s a transition period agreed with the U.K. in the customs union until Dec. 2020, a final solution for the Northern Ireland border isn’t needed to be fully in place until that period ends.Does this open the door to the U.K. fully accepting the EU’s default backstop position?Read more: Why Ireland’s Border Is Brexit’s Intractable Puzzle: QuickTakeDavis Says U.K. to Avoid Hard Border in Ireland (9:32 a.m.)

        “Our undertaking is plain,” Davis says. “We will avoid a hard border at all costs. We will underpin the peace process… and we will come up with a mechanism which will enable that to happen at the border.”Davis says a free trade agreement with the EU would solve a lot of the issues.Davis Says Lawmakers Will Be Able to Amend Bill (9:29 a.m.)Davis flicks at the power the U.K. Parliament will have when it gets to vote on the draft Brexit deal that Prime Minister Theresa May secures. “If the house rejects the proposed negotiation then that negotiation will fall,” he says.But he’s also evasive on how long lawmakers will have to scrutinize the deal. “I don’t know,” he says. The beginning of this hearing is already rather combative.Read more: Lawmakers Could Still Thwart Brexit When Deal Reaches ParliamentEarlier:Brexit Bulletin: A Concession and a NudgeEU Said to Be Ready to Give U.K. a Say on Trade in Customs UnionBrexit-Backer Fox Offers an Argument for Keeping Customs UnionLords Defeat May Again on Brexit, This Time Over RightsComing Up:Prime Minister’s Questions in ParliamentTheresa May’s Brexit war cabinet meets in Downing Street
