The culprits have plugged the cables into a nearby transformer station. ‎The police went to inspect the ‎spot after a local energy supplier reported significant power losses coming ‎from the mining area, nearly 28 percent at peak consumption hours. A search of ‎the area led to the discovery of over 600 mining computers connected via ‎electrical cables in what the police described as “largest power theft case in recent years.”‎“Eight high-power fans were also seized,” Xinhua added.China and several countries have recently intensified their efforts to crack down on ‎cryptocurrency mining, which involves an energy-intensive process of solving math ‎problems to add transactions to the blockchain.‎This isn’t the first time cryptocurrency miners have been accused of ‎illegally using subsidized electricity in China, which its authorities ‎previously called for an orderly exit from the industry.The country’s miners have played a major role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem where they ‎once accounted for 70 percent of all mined bitcoins. ‎‎While cryptocurrency mining is not a fraudulent practice in itself, its ‎necessary for miners to carry out these operations in compliance with ‎guidelines applicable to their localities.‎ googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: bitcoinmining / MiningRelated News NEO Blockchain’s First Decentralized Exchange Goes Live  German ICO Savedroid Pulls Exit Scam After Raising $50 Million  Iceland: Bitcoin Mining Thief Escapes Jail, Flies to Sweden with PM  Got a news tip?
