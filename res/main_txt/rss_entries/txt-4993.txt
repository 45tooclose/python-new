  Bitcoin (BTC) spent the entire week above $9,000, but was shy to cross the $10,000 barrier again. At the same time, altcoins had their boom times, marking a successful month in April after the slide that continued between mid-January and the end of March.

Bitcoin (BTC) heads for the weekend at $9676.06, up around 4.28 net this week, as the price rises only gradually. The price spikes in BTC are still tentative, as BTC added around 4.7% in the past 24 hours.

Bitcoin trading has decreased its share on the markets, down to around 30% from habitual levels above 36%. Additionally, Bitcoin’s market cap dominance over the market is shrinking again, as altcoins are appreciating. The market cap dominance of BTC is headed below 37%. Tether (USDT) trading has increased above 14% of all deals, but also affects altcoins, and particularly, EOS.




Ethereum (ETH) Headed for $800?




Ethereum (ETH) is showing some strength as it gradually rose in the past month. ETH is up more than 17% this week, as selling pressures subsided, and trading volumes have picked up to above $4 billion in 24 hours. ETH rose to $776.64.
Ripple (XRP) stagnated again at $0.90, adding just 6% this week, breaking the fast growing trend and consolidating below $1.
Bitcoin Cash (BCH, BCC) is making the fight for $1,500 levels. Despite the bad publicity, BCH managed to jump over that level on one occasion last week. BCH trades at $1,488.52, adding a net 6.5% this week.
EOS (EOS) continued to surprise, touching $20 this week before retreating a bit. The asset added a net 6.8% this week to $17.82. At one point, EOS trading took over 12% of all crypto deals, but since then, the interest has slid and the share of EOS has fallen to 7%, still extremely robust compared to altcoins. But some believe the asset is overhyped and due for a deep correction.
Cardano (ADA) moved up the charts as the price is taking off. ADA was the biggest gainer in the top 10 of coins, adding another 21% to $0.36 for the week. But the asset is retreating ahead of the weekend.
Litecoin (LTC) inched up, adding another 6% this week to $161.90, as the asset had remained depressed for weeks and is staging a minor rally now.
Stellar (XLM) steadied at $0.43, after adding around 4% on the week. The Stellar project has been silent for a while, and the asset is off the spotlight after the strong weekly performance of EOS.

IOTA (MIOTA) awakened from its slumber after the latest updates on the coming Trinity wallet. MIOTA added more than 17% in the past seven days, to $2.39, as volumes were returning, though not dramatically.
NEO (NEO) had a robust week with a 12% growth to $85.52, as the project moves along and gets a boost from Asian trading. The Binance monthly payment of the GAS asset spiked some interest in NEO.
TRON (TRX) continues to enjoy high-level publicity as it counts down to the launch of the mainnet at the end of May. But the price has some setbacks. TRX steadied to $0.083, sliding a bit in the past day to achieve a net 12% weekly gain.
Monero (XMR) hardly made notice of the MoneroV hard fork that happened at the beginning of May. XMR was one of the few losers this week, sliding a net 5% to $246.60. 
DASH (DASH) remained off the spotlight and level at $463.65, adding less than 1% net this week, as the project failed to impress with its master node algorithm changes.
NEM (XEM) gained a net 7% on the week to $0.43, but attention remains focused on other projects.
Last week also saw the pump for Primecoin (XPM) create unprecedented hype with the promise of a merge-fork into Bitcoin Prime. But XPM started to slide soon afterwards, to $3.28. Still, the asset is up 252% this week. ZClassic (ZCL), which surged as high as $39, is down 8% on the week to $20.73, as the expectations for another merge-fork related to the asset were dispelled and no announcement was made.
