By the end of 2017, there were 27,000 company-operated and licensed stores globally. With humble beginnings, Starbucks' explosive success is among the many great American business stories that entrepreneurs study.
While Starbucks is known for its coffee, the company continues to find growth through other beverages, such as tea, beer and wine. Starbucks has also continued to focus on its café presence through a wider range of food options, stylish restaurant remodeling, a revamped rewards program and continued international expansion. The company is making a major push into China, reportedly opening a new location every 15 hours. The company reported a strong FY 2017, with Non-GAAP* earnings per share (“EPS”) growing 11.4% over FY 2016, to $2.06 per share.

He later incorporated Starbucks in 1985, after his Il Giornale Coffee Company bought up Starbucks Coffee Company's assets. Since returning to Starbucks in 2008, Schultz served as the president and CEO. At the end of 2016, he announced that he would be turning over the position of CEO to Kevin Johnson.
