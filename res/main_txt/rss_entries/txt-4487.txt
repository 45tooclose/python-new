      The Federal Farm Credit System, or FFCS, is a network of financial institutions that provide credit and financing for farming and agriculture in the United States. The FFCS is an important source of financing for the agricultural industry, because agricultural business can be seen as high-risk by traditional lenders. For example, even if a farmer has excellent credit and a strategic business plan, a season of drought, unseasonable temperatures, or unexpected international conflicts can drastically affect their bottom line. The FFCS provides farmers and rural homeowners with credit that they would not be likely to attain through a commercial lender.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Federal Farm Credit System - FFCS'
      The FFCS has evolved and grown significantly in the past 100 years. In 1916, Congress passed the Federal Farm Loan Act, establishing Federal Land Banks, or FLBs, in a dozen districts around the country, as well as hundreds of National Farm Loan Associations, or NFLAs. These entities would form the basis of what would become known as the Federal Farm Credit System.
The Farm Loan Act created a way for farmers to secure long-term loans. Later, the Agricultural Credits Act of 1923, created a dozen Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, or FICBs, that allowed farmers to procure discounted short-term loans through cooperatives. By 1968, the U.S. government had been repaid all of the capital is had lent through the FFCS. This meant that the financial institutions of the FFCS were now completely owned by the farmers who used them to borrow money.
The 1970s saw a huge boom for U.S. farmers as demand for U.S. agricultural products grew, along with land values. Agricultural lending skyrocketed during this time. However, the boom ultimately led to production surpluses, low prices, and up to 300,000 farmers on the brink of failure. FFCS institutions in 1985 posted losses of $2.7 billion. In 1986, losses were $1.9 billion. These represented the largest losses in the history of any U.S. financial institution. Congress stepped in with the Farm Credit Amendments Act of 1985 and the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987. Together, these acts brought federal oversight, regulation, and enforcement to the FFCS, along with $4 billion in federal assistance. At this time Farmer Mac was created.
The FFCS today
All financial assistance that FCS institutions received from the U.S. Treasury as bailouts was fully repaid (with interest) by 2005. Today, the FFCS consists of three Farm Credit Banks, or FCBs, 72 Agricultural Credit Associations, or ACAs, one Federal Land Credit Association, or FLCA, and one Agricultural Credit Bank, or CoBank. The CoBank can provide loans to ACAs, the FLCA, agricultural cooperatives, rural utilities and aquatic cooperatives. It can also help finance imports and exports of U.S. agricultural products and provide international banking services for farmer-owned cooperatives.
