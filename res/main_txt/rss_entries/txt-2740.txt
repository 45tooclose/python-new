      A Net Revenue Pledge is a provision that requires issuers of municipal bonds to use their net revenues (revenues minus expenses) to pay the principal and interest of the municipal bond before using them for other purposes. The expenses to be paid first include operating and maintenance costs of the public works project being paid for by the municipal bond.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Net Revenue Pledge'
      Net Revenue Pledges are restrictive covenants intended to mitigate risk for bondholders. The intent is that the issuer has to use the revenues from the financed project to pay debt services first, thereby lowering the risk of default. As a result, bonds with net revenue pledges often have higher debt ratings than those that do not.
There are two basic types of municipal bonds: general obligation bonds and revenue bonds. Revenue bonds are secured by revenues derived from tolls, charges, or rents from the facility built with the proceeds from the bond issue. A Net Revenue Pledge is a way of governing the repayment priority of revenue bonds, and they have an impact on the flow of funds for the bond issuer.
The flow of funds is the schedule of expenses and interested parties that prioritizes how payments will be made from the revenue generated by a public works project financed by municipal bond. In a Gross Revenue Pledge, the debt service is paid before the operating and maintenance expenses, which elevates debt service higher in the repayment priority than in a Net Revenue Pledge. However, this isn’t necessarily preferred by bondholders, who may want the facility the bond is financing maintained in good repair so that people continue to use it and it continues to generate revenue, as would be better assured by a Net Revenue Pledge.
Pledged revenue, or the money obligated for the payment of debt service and for the making of other deposits required by the bond contract, and the flow of funds are of critical importance when analyzing revenue bonds. Municipal bond analysts take these factors into account when considering the financial viability of projects.
Example of ‘Net Revenue Pledge’
Public projects financed by revenue bonds that can include Net Revenue Pledges can include airports, universities, bridges, water and sewage treatment facilities, hospitals, and subsidized housing.  An example of a Net Revenue Pledge in action would be if a bond issue raises $10 million and the construction of the new public toll road it will finance only costs $8 million. In this example, the issuer would be required to use the remaining $2 million to pay back the debt from the bond.
