Maas went on to say that Germany “understands” the history of Ireland and that everything possible must be done to avoid a ‘flare-up” in violence as he pledged Germany’s full support in avoiding a hard border in Ireland after Brexit.

        Standing behind him, a beaming Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney promised to treat Maas to a trip to Cork, where he’d backpacked in his younger days.   A beautiful day for him.
