Rockefeller’s VC Arm Venrock Feels Lure of Cryptocurrencies Venrock plans to invest in blockchain startups using the traditional venture ‎capital ‎fashion‎.    Aziz Abdel-Qader  |  News ( CryptoCurrency )  |   Friday, 27/04/2018 | 18:06 GMT   Photo: FMShare this articleDespite the rise of so-called initial coin offerings, or ICOs, cryptocurrency startups ‎are still landing venture capital funding. US venture capital firm Venrock ‎Associates is now branching out into the cryptocurrency space as the company that sprang from the Rockefeller fortune wants to get a piece of the action.‎David Pakman, a partner at the New York-based firm, told Bloomberg that the ‎VC fund will invest explicitly in firms that focus on blockchain and digital ‎currencies.‎Venrock plans to invest in blockchain startups using the traditional venture capital ‎fashion, offering cash in return for equity, before any potential ICO. It’s too early ‎to say for certain whether the change will lead to outsized investment ‎returns, ‎but Pakman says these tokens have the potential to ‎increase in value and can be traded – thus providing investors with a means to cash ‎in.   ‎“I think this is one of the most transformative tech ecosystems and has the ‎possibility of creating hundreds of companies worth billions of dollars each,” ‎Pakman said.‎Venrock has already joined a Brooklyn-based cryptocurrency ‎investor group called CoinFund, which helps startups build ‎blockchain-based projects.‎‎“I am approaching this from the very first that this is a fundamentally ‎interesting technological innovation that enabled very serious value creation ‎and may also be a legitimate way to build value away from internet platforms ‎of today,” Pakman added.‎Venrock was established in 1969 by the grandson of John Rockefeller as the ‎investment business of the Rockefeller family, although the firm opened up to outside ‎investors in 1995.‎Over the years, Venrock invested in what would later become web giants, ‎including Intel, Apple and LinkedIn, among many other big winners. As such, the firm is also feeling the lure of cryptocurrencies and fear the potential ‎downside if they miss the boat. ‎ googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: Crypto news / Venture CapitalRelated News IOTA to Demonstrate IoT Applications at Industry Conference in Germany Tomorrow  Exclusive: Charlie Lee Confirms Exploring Bank Acquisition with TokenPay  FX Veteran, Ex-Jefferies Executive Ray Kamrath Launches Cryptocurrency Firm  Got a news tip?
