Circle is adding the privacy-focused cryptocurrency zcash to its list of offerings for its investment app, the startup announced Monday.
Users of the company's Circle Invest platform can now purchase and invest the cryptocurrency, the company explained in a new blog post. The token joins bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, ethereum classic and litecoin as available currencies through the app.
"Our mission for Circle Invest is to democratize access to investing in crypto assets for every consumer. Making the wider breadth of assets available on Circle Invest will continue to be a part of this mission, and of course doing our best to ensure that we bring the crypto without the cryptic to everyone, anywhere," the startup wrote.
The investment app was first unveiled last year and debuted in March, as CoinDesk reported at the time. While it was initially excluded, residents of the U.S. state of New York can now access the app, according to the company. The other states - Minnesota, Wyoming and Hawaii - remain unavailable, according to Circle Invest senior product manager Rachel Mayer. 

She told CoinDesk that "Circle has an established working group dedicated to finding the best crypto assets for our customers," but declined to say why zcash specifically was chosen.
However, tokens on the platform must be "consistent with our regulatory licensure," she explained.
