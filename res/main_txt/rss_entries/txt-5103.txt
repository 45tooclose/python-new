      The Commodity Exchange Act, or CEA, provides federal regulation of all futures trading activities. Passed by the US government in 1936, the CEA essentially replaced the Grain Futures Act of 1922. It is designed to prevent and remove obstructions on interstate commerce in commodities by regulating transactions on commodity futures exchanges. The CEA looks to limit or abolish short selling and eliminate the possibility of manipulation. Notably, the CEA established the statutory framework under which the Commodity Futures Trading Commission operates.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Commodity Exchange Act - CEA'
      The Commodity Exchange Act gives the CFTC the authority to establish regulations that are published in Title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations. CFTC regulations are found at Title 17 Chapter I of the Code of Federal Regulations. Broadly, the CFTC’s goals include the promotion of competitive and efficient futures markets and the protection of investors against manipulation, abusive trade practices and fraud.
Without such regulation and regulators, market participants could be subjected to fraud and, in turn, lose faith in the country’s capital markets. This could make capital markets ineffective at efficiently allocating financial resources to the most deserving means of production and productive economic activities to the detriment of investors, consumers and society. 
The CFTC has five committees, each headed by a commissioner, who is appointed by the president and approved by the Senate. These five committees focus on agriculture, global markets, energy and environmental markets, technology, and cooperation between the CFTC and the Securities Exchange Commission. The committees represent the interests of specific industries, traders, futures exchanges, commodities exchanges, consumers and the environment.
Modern challenges for the CEA
Financial technology, such as cloud computing, algorithmic trading, distributed ledgers and artificial intelligence pose new challenges for the CFTC in the modern digital age. Virtual currencies, or the digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value, are another challenge. The crypto-currency Bitcoin had a futures contract launched in late 2017 that trades with the CME Group.
Notably, virtual currencies have been determined to be commodities under the CEA. There are limitations to its regulatory oversight over commodity cash markets; the CFTC has general anti-fraud and manipulation enforcement authority over virtual currency cash markets as a commodity in interstate commerce. These technologies have the potential for significant or even transformational impact on CFTC-regulated markets and the agency itself. The CFTC plans to play an active role in the oversight of this emerging innovation.
