REUTERS/Toru HanaiShare this articleKabu.com, a subsidiary of Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFJ), has reported its preliminary results for its trading volumes and metrics for March 2018. The latest results encompass both futures and options, which saw a retreat that established fresh yearly lows.During March 2018, Kabu’s futures and options volumes resumed a downtrend that has been intact since January. Looking specifically at trading volumes for the month, the latest figures came in at ¥29.3 billion ($273 million), a fall of -15 percent month-over-month from ¥34.4 billion ($325.4 ‎million) in February 2018.Moreover, over-the-counter (OTC) FX trading accounts notched a marginal climb in March 2018, inching higher to 93,241 accounts, slightly up month-over-month from 92,968 accounts in February 2018 – accounts have been held to a tight consolidation in Q1 2018, though the number has risen 5 percent year-over-year.The performance of Kabu’s volumes on a month-over-month basis in each of these segments will largely be driven by the direction and movement of the yen moving forward in April.The declines in each of these segments were the result of a declining volatility – the trend was somewhat universal as most brokerage firms, including Japanese venues, saw their volumes ticking lower in March, which didn’t react to any major market drivers. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: FX Volumes / japan forex / kabu.comRelated News Breaking: FCA to Ban All Bonuses, Proposes 1:50 Leverage Cap  BinaryOptionsThatSuck.com Launches Communitraders 2.0 Social Trading Platform  CME Group Discloses MoM Drop in March FX Options  Got a news tip?
