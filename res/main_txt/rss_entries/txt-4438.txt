Last month, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani joined the group of lawyers outside the White House after the former head of that team, John Dowd, quit earlier this year amid disagreements about strategy.The news of Cobb’s retirement comes just hours after he conducted an interview with ABC News in which he said "people are working hard to make decisions and work towards an interview" with Special Counsel Robert Mueller."Assuming that can be concluded favorably, there’ll be an interview,” Cobb said in the interview.Trump May ‘Get Involved’ in House Republicans’ Rift With DOJEarlier this week, the Times published a list of more than 40 questions it said that Mueller’s team wanted the president to answer.
