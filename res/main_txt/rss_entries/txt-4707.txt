      The truck tonnage index is an index that measures the gross tonnage of freight that is transported by motor carriers in the United States for a given month. The truck tonnage index serves as an indicator of shipping activity and consumption of goods in the U.S. It can also be used by analysts to help determine the state of the U.S. economy. This is because over 70 percent of all freight tonnage transported in the U.S. is transported via truck.
The index is weighted proportionately to reflect the current composition of the trucking industry. It is also calculated with a seasonal adjustment, and there is a one-month lag between the time that the data is compiled and when it is reported. A rise in the index is generally seen as a rise in the economy, because it indicates that production is up, as well as of consumption of retail goods.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Truck Tonnage Index'
      The truck tonnage index was first introduced in 1973 by the American Trucking Association, abbreviated as the ATA. The ATA was formed in 1933 as an advocacy group for the trucking industry.  The ATA aims to educate both the public and policy makers about the importance of the trucking industry’s role in the economy, and the index has proved to be a valuable tools toward that goal. Both raw materials and consumer goods for retail sales are shipped domestically via truck.
The truck tonnage index today
In 2016, 10.55 billion tons of freight were shipped within the U.S. by truck. This represented $738.9 billion in gross freight revenues from trucking. Beyond the revenue generated by trucking, the industry also contributes to the economy through payment of federal and state highway-user taxes. In 2015, these taxes added up to $41.3 billion. The ATA estimates that there are aver 3.5 million truck drivers in the U.S. contributing to these numbers.
In March of 2018, the truck tonnage index read at 110, which was a 1.1 percent decrease from its reading of 111.2 in February of the same year. Before that, the index had dropped in January as well. However, the ATA’s Chief Economist, Bob Costello does not anticipate further declines. This is partly because the index, though in slight decline, still ranked higher than it did during the same months in 2017. Costello told TruckingInfo.com, “While I expect the pace of growth to continue moderating in the months ahead…the levels of freight will remain good going forward,”
