German Bank VPE  Brings Cryptocurrency Trading to Institutional Investors Clients will receive a custodian ‎service with ‎access to an individual cryptocurrency ‎wallet hosted by VPE. ‎    Aziz Abdel-Qader  |  News ( CryptoCurrency )  |   Wednesday, 25/04/2018 | 20:22 GMT   Photo: iStockShare this articleGerman bank VPE has partnered with Berlin-based fintech company ‎solarisBank to facilitate cryptocurrency trading for institutional ‎investors, like hedge and pension funds.‎The Securities trading provider is regulated by Germany’s financial ‎watchdog, Bafin, and will become the first to offer such services in the ‎country.‎VPE said the ecosystem wasn’t prepared to handle large traders a ‎couple years ago, and their customers weren’t asking for such digital assets. ‎That all changed in 2017 after crypto market has gone mainstream as an ‎asset class.‎Unlike established financial markets, cryptocurrency trading are dominated by ‎individual investors, which is evident by almost every metric, including the sharp price swings.‎Institutional investors and trading firms were eager to actively trade ‎these instruments following the launch of bitcoin futures contracts ‎by two of the leading futures exchanges in the U.S.‎ But although the Cboe and CME futures has allowed digital currencies to ‎step into the mainstream financial system, the big players were‎ challenged by lack of institutional-grade technology to ‎support them.‎The statement also revealed that solarisBank will offer a custodian ‎service while customers will also receive access to an individual cryptocurrency ‎wallet hosted by VPE. This will deliver stringent financial controls as well ‎as secure storage, the company said.‎‎ Commenting on this, Katharina Strenski, Public Relations ‎Manager at VPE, said: ‎”Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and others have ‎become a promising asset class in recent years. To date, trading digital ‎tokens has been restricted to crypto exchanges and online market places. ‎We are pleased to be the first German bank to offer our customers ‎cryptocurrency trading services.”‎”Until now, institutional investors have faced high entry barriers to crypto ‎trading. Our cryptocurrency trading services offer a much more convenient ‎alternative,” Strenski added.‎ googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: Crypto news / crypto regulationsRelated News NEO Blockchain’s First Decentralized Exchange Goes Live  IOTA to Demonstrate IoT Applications at Industry Conference in Germany Tomorrow  Intangible labs Grabs $133 Million From Big Investors Backing Basecoin  Got a news tip?
