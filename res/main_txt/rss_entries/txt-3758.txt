      A joint bond, or a joint-and-several bond, is one in which interest and principal are guaranteed by two or more parties. In the case of default, the bond holders have the right to claim the assets of all the issuing institutions, corporations, or individuals. This reduces risk and borrowing costs.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Joint Bond'
      Joint bonds can include any combination of parties, but they are commonly used when a parent company is required to guarantee the bonds of a subsidiary. In such an instance, debt holders may not be interested in taking a debt investment in a subsidiary that may not share a credit rating quite as high as its parent, thus the parent company will act as an additional guarantor on the debt.
Examples of Joint Bond
Another example of a long-time joint bond issuer is the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which was founded by Congress in 1932 to finance housing and community lending. The FHLBanks Office of Finance issues joint bond securities to provide financing to the nation’s 11 Federal Home Loan Banks. This financing is then passed on to local financial institutions to support lending to homeowners, farmers and small businesses. The Federal Home Loan Bank’s organizational structure of joint and several liability makes it unique among housing-related government-sponsored enterprises, helping it serve as a pillar of the nation’s housing and small-business finance system.
Many economists argue that the European Union should consider issuing joint bonds in order to strengthen the European currency union. The threat of Greece’s exit from the eurozone in 2014 illustrates their point. Greece was unable to stimulate its way out of a local recession because it had no local currency to devalue, and advocates of joint bonds argued that for this reason Greece needed the support and credit of its fellow eurozone members so that it could pay its bills until growth began again.
Proposals for European joint bonds, or European common bonds, are floated intermittently. The latest iteration is called a European Safe Bond, as proposed in 2018 by a committee chaired by Irish central bank governor Philip Lane. European banks and many governments would be supportive of such proposals, as it would meet demand for safe government debt, and also dampen the chance of financial panic. Such proposals, however, are usually blocked by Germany, who’s representatives are wary that a European joint bond would encourage fiscal irresponsibility in the European periphery.
