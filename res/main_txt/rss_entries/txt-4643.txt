Integral Posts Record Volumes after Integrating Buy-Side Systems into FX ECN The foreign exchange market focused tech company posted average daily volumes of $35 billion in April    Victor Golovtchenko  |  Execution ( Institutional FX )  |   Thursday, 03/05/2018 | 13:31 GMT   Photo: FMShare this articleIntegral has announced that last month it registered a record amount of trading volumes. The Average Daily Volumes (ADVs) transacted via the firm’s foreign exchange trading infrastructure totaled $35 billion in April 2018.The news follows on Integral’s successful integration of numerous buy-side systems into Integral’s OCX ECN.During the first four months of 2018 trading at Integral has been consistently strong. The company reports ADVs averaged between $34.5 billion and $38.5 billion. The totals reflect single count trading volumes originating from BankFXTM, MarginFXTM, InvestorFXTM, and Integral MTFTM in all transaction types, including spot, forwards, and swaps.Commenting on the news, the CEO of Integral Harpal Sandhu said: “Integral continues to advance its platform to meet significant new regulatory requirements. In the process, we have worked closely with our customers to integrate their systems, and as a result, they have consolidated trading over OCX, the most reliable yet flexible trading network available in the FX market.”Integral’s OCX is directly cross-connected to over 250 liquidity sources and supplies more than 3,000 market making streams via NY4, LD4, and TY3.The company’s metrics are broadly in line with industry trends, as the first four months of the year have proven to be quite positive for the FX industry. Trading volumes rebounded in the aftermath of a material rise in demand from traders.Volatility in the FX market started in January with a rapid fall in the dollar, a trend that as of the end of April started to reverse. Major ECNs reported that April was slower than March 2018, albeit not materially so. Integral appears to be bucking the trend last month as somewhat lower volatility and range trading dominated the bigger part of last month. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: ecn / integral / trading volumesRelated News Former HSBC Trader Sentenced to Two Years in Prison over Front-Running Scam  Former RBC FX Trader John Banerjee Sues Bank for £13m  Stater Global Markets Extends Access to Cboe FX and FastMatch  Got a news tip?
