RBS Axes Further 792 Jobs, Closes 162 Branches Amid Digital Transformation The fresh job losses came despite the lender reported ‎‎last month its first full-year profit in a decade.‎    Aziz Abdel-Qader  |  Technology ( Institutional FX )  |   Tuesday, 01/05/2018 | 23:19 GMT   Photo: BloombergShare this articleRoyal Bank of Scotland, which is still 70%-owned by British taxpayers, has ‎accelerated its job-cutting scheme, axing a further 792 jobs and closing 162 ‎branches as customers increasingly turned to online banking.‎The posts that are being axed are part of a job reductions plan that was first ‎announced by the bailed-out bank last year. It also follows on closure of ‎‎259 branches in December as RBS progresses an ongoing restructuring program to cut ‎costs and save an extra $3.45 billion by the end of 2020.‎The news of fresh job losses came despite the state-backed lender reported ‎last month its first full-year profit in a decade.‎An RBS spokesman said they have made the difficult decision ‎to close a number of Royal Bank of Scotland branches that were too close to one another – within 0.6 and 2.5 miles.‎He added: ‎“We realize this is difficult news for our colleagues and we are doing ‎everything we can to support those affected. We will ensure compulsory ‎redundancies are kept to an absolute minimum.”RBS’s CEO ‎has previously signaled further job cuts as Britain’s biggest government-owned lender ‎accelerates its investment in technology.‎Staff at the Edinburgh-based lender were told by their line managers on ‎Wednesday about the job losses, which cover large parts of the group ‎including retail, group operations, marketing and finance and risk division.‎The Union Unite criticised RBS plans to axe further UK jobs dubbing today’s ‎announcement “horrific news for staff”. The organization said it will oppose ‎all job losses and challenge senior management to ensure all those affected ‎by this latest round of announcements be offered alternative suitable ‎employment.‎ googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: jobs / rbsRelated News Former HSBC Trader Sentenced to Two Years in Prison over Front-Running Scam  Former RBC FX Trader John Banerjee Sues Bank for £13m  Deutsche Bank Initiates Layoffs in Cost-Cutting Effort  Got a news tip?
