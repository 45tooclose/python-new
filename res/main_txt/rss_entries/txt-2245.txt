MarketWatch, the news publishing unit of Dow Jones Media Group, announced Wednesday that it will begin tracking the market moves of eight additional cryptocurrencies.
On Wednesday, the company said that on top of its bitcoin tracking tool, MarketWatch will display information for ether, XRP, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether classic, monero, dash and zcash. The website has been tracking the price of bitcoin since 2014.
The new service will post real-time quotes for both the U.S. dollar and the euro - as well as historical price trends for the nine crypto-assets - using data from the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.
"It's no doubt that our readers, as the world's savviest investors, have an eye on digital currency and we're happy to be expanding our real-time tracking of a total of 9 cryptocurrencies in both Euro's and USD, with Kraken's help," Dan Shar, general manager at MarketWatch, said in a statement. 

The Dow Jones Media Group itself has moved to test blockchain in recent days, perhaps signaling a broader interest i the tech within the company past its offerings on MarketWatch.
Dow Jones said last week that it is working with the privacy-oriented Web browser startup Brave in order to trial its blockchain platform. The two firms will test delivering content using Brave's blockchain-based platform for digital advertising, and Dow Jones Media Group subsidiaries Barron's and MarketWatch will become "verified publishers," as previously reported.
