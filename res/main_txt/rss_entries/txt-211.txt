These developments present a wide range of new features and upgrades geared toward improving the user experience and capabilities offered by the platform. The group has introduced the new Market Watch feature and Advanced Maker Controls, with a particular emphasis on institutional clients.The latest upgrades follow on the heels of two new versions of its Liquidity Hub in Q1 2018. The enhancements build on existing updates, as previously reported by Finance Magnates late last year. As such, oneZero is looking to expand multi-asset trading capabilities for brokerages that currently utilize oneZero for FX/CFD and OTC instrument routing.This stance was echoed by Andrew Ralich, CEO of oneZero, who commented exclusively to Finance Magnates: “After deploying a large number of institutional and B2B clients in 2017, while also increasing multi-asset connectivity on the back-end, we thought it prudent to look at how the user experience supported our expanded capabilities.”New updatesThe new Market Watch feature introduced by oneZero will aim to enable customers to view markets and provide their clients the ability to view real-time market data in a way that aligns with their unique business models.“We identified a number of instances in the Hub where we could add a tremendous amount of flexibility by building on existing functionality, especially for our growing base of Institutional brokers. Over the past few years, we’ve found a real rhythm in continuously updating and investing inthe expansion of our software,” explained Mr. Ralich.In doing so, this gives oneZero’s customers a way to configure a market-viewing platform without the need for third-party integrations. This improvement also allows these individuals to demonstrate their liquidity feed to potential customers without connecting them via a traditional FIX session.One of the primary forces behind oneZero’s updates has been the increased demand for these utilities. “We respond to trends within our client base and direct requests from brokers, and over the last few quarters, a tremendous amount of new demand has come from the Institutional and B2B space with regard to how oneZero’s software can be expanded into new verticals,” he noted.“Market Watch makes our Liquidity Hub easier to use, easier to understand and easier for our brokerage clients to demonstrate the unique liquidity pool they’ve built, using our technology, to their clients,” reiterated Mr. Ralich.Focusing on Advanced Maker Controls In addition to Market Watch, oneZero’s Advanced Maker Controls is also providing new forms of maker control. This extends to Liquidity Hub users over the pricing they get from the makers with whom they trade and from where they aggregate pricing. Using an easy-to-read, intuitive interface, users can now monitor spreads, freeze all pricing from a maker, or drill-down and halt pricing on a per-symbol basis – all on one page.In addition to the hands-on functionality enhancements, brokers and third-party developers, who have built on top of oneZero’s platform via REST API can fully automate all of the above capabilities using REST API endpoints.Finally, the Replication Trade Capture Adapter (RTCA) is a powerful new tool that allows Liquidity Hub users to leverage their research on trading trends into parameters for automating and optimizing their trading business. Using the Replication Trade Capture Adapter, users can trigger additional trade requests in response to behavior within their Hub in either the same or opposite direction of the resulting signal.Active Q1oneZero has had an active Q1, capped off with multiple deals and partnerships with leading venues over the past months. This includes its partnership with CMC Markets to improve the offering of its multi-asset liquidity feed to additional counterparties. Furthermore, Invast Global’s prime brokerage unit added its liquidity to the London oneZero Hub located on the premises of Equinix (LD4) in March.oneZero’s most recent updates continue to cater towards its institutional offering, driven by rising user demand. Looking ahead in 2018, the rollout of the Market Watch feature and Advanced Maker Control as part of its Liquidity Hub will look to further bolster oneZero’s market penetration in this space. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: Api / forex / Maker Controls / Market Watch / onezero / software / technologyRelated News Philippines Bankers Association Partners With Bloomberg to Boost FX Market  Financial Commission Increases Liability Limits of Its Compensation Fund  FXCM Group Extends Algo Tools, Adds REST API and Python Wrapper  Got a news tip?
