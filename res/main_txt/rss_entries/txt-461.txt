            A former Hungarian government ally-turned-opposition supporter shut down most of his news empire, in a sign that Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s overwhelming election victory may further weaken independent media.Magyar Nemzet, a national daily newspaper established in 1938, said on its website Tuesday that it was working on its last edition. Lanchid radio, which belongs to the same media group owned by Lajos Simicska, will also shut down. HirTV, a 24-hour news network, will stay on air but will cut jobs, 444.hu news website reported, without citing anyone. Staff at Heti Valasz weekly will be given an opportunity to find a new investor, 444.hu said.Orban, who won a third consecutive parliamentary supermajority, has used the past eight years to extend his influence over the media as part of an unprecedented centralization of power despite European Union objections. Public media has been used as a channel for government propaganda and Orban pushed his allies to buy up key private media outlets. Hungary plunged to 71st place on the World Press Freedom Index last year, from 23rd when the prime minister returned to power in 2010.

        Simicska was a former ally of Orban until he fell out with the prime minister in 2015. That prompted Simicska to use his media empire to back the opposition and publish stories on corruption. Nepszabadsag, once the biggest opposition daily, shut down in 2016 after Orban’s allies bought it. Widely-read regional newspapers also passed into ownership friendly to Orban’s Fidesz party and now often churn out near-identical content on the premier.Read more: on a U.S. attempt to boost Hungarian media pluralismThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitored the election, said the campaign was “characterized by a pervasive overlap between state and ruling party resources, undermining contestants’ ability to compete on an equal basis” in the media.“Hungary is a constitutional democracy,” Orban told reporters in Budapest, rejecting criticism that the shrinking space for media and civil society undermined its democracy. He said he won’t comment about privately-owned media outlets.Simicska’s outlets were often considered friendly to the Jobbik party, a former radical nationalist group that moved toward the political center. While Jobbik became the largest opposition party, its 19 percent national-list result and 25 mandates in the 199-seat parliament fell well short of its own expectations. Chairman Gabor Vona resigned from both his position in the party and as a lawmaker.Media Remnants

        Fidesz plans to step up its crackdown of civil society groups, one of the last remaining sources of scrutiny into Orban’s government along with the remnants of independent media.The legislation dubbed a “Stop Soros” bill will the among the first laws passed by the new parliament, a Fidesz spokesman said on Monday. Named after the Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros, who Orban has accused of trying to flood Europe with refugees, the bill is aimed at limiting, and potentially preventing, foreign funding of non-governmental organizations and penalizing those seen as supporting illegal immigration.It drives home Orban’s unbridled anti-immigrant campaign message, which has made him a role model for anti-establishment parties challenging the EU’s democratic values from Poland to France.
