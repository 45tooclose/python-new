            Loud explosions were heard in the night sky above Riyadh on Wednesday night as state-run television said Iranian-backed Houthi rebels targeted the capital with a ballistic missile from Yemen.Saudi Arabia last month said it intercepted seven ballistic missiles fired at Riyadh and other cities by the Houthis, the biggest such barrage since the kingdom went to war against them in March 2015.While Saudi Arabia’s allies have been able to recover areas in southern Yemen from the Houthis, the rebels still control the capital Sana’a and territories in the north. Saudi Arabia has repeatedly blamed Iran for supplying projectiles for rebel missile attacks, a charge Tehran rejects.
