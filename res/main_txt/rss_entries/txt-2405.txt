Europe’s fastest-growing unicorn has quite the reputation.
In October 2017 CEO Nikolay Storonsky raised $71 million at a valuation of $350 million. Today his company is announcing that it’s quintupled its valuation to $1.7 billion, following a record $250 million funding round led by Hong Kong’s DST Global.
Its new valuation makes Revolut worth more than TransferWise and Monzo combined, and positions it as Europe’s most valuable fintech unicorn.
 Storonsky told Forbes that his stake in Revolut is being diluted to 30%, which would give him a paper fortune worth $510 million.
But how has Storonsky achieved so much in such a short space of time?
“Just working super-hard,” he told Forbes.
 
 
“The whole culture we've built, the team, how we approach things, how we execute, we do it in the right way.”
