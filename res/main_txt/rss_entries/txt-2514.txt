																		The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued a subpoena to Riot Blockchain, the cryptocurrency company whose stock skyrocketed after changing its name, the company said on Tuesday.
															
																													
					
			
	
												    														Riot's annual 10K report disclosed that it had received the SEC subpoena on April 9 "requesting certain information from the Company."
															
																										    														It "intends to fully cooperate with the SEC request," the report said. "The Company has notified its insurance carrier although there can be no assurance that the costs of compliance with the subpoena or any related matters will be eligible for insurance coverage. Nevertheless, response to the subpoena will entail cost and management's attention."
