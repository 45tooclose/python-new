      BREAKING DOWN 'Treasury Budget '
      The U.S. Treasury Budget is the monthly account of the surplus or deficit of the federal government. The treasury budget is an important tool for the federal government, because any changes in the budget balance may result in changes in federal policy on spending and taxation.
The Treasury Budget and Financial Markets
The treasury budget date also has an impact for financial markets, both directly and indirectly. Treasury securities are the most directly impacted by the monthly statement, specifically when the monthly budget states a higher deficit. The deficit in the monthly budget directly correlates to how many treasury notes and bonds the government needs to sell to finance federal operations. This means that as the deficit deficit increases, more treasury notes and bonds are sold to finance the United States government.
If demand remains constant and supply of treasury securities increases, the value of the instruments goes down. Alternatively, the opposite also sometimes occurs. If the deficit goes down, or is eliminated, the government will issue fewer treasury securities and the price of the security instruments increase. It is a system of supply and demand.
Lower prices in bonds and notes equate to higher yields for the investor. Higher yields in the market means the government must issue treasury securities at higher interest rates. When these risk-free rates are increased, the effect is seen across all debt markets, and a high interest rate environment is born. This is bearish for the equity markets.
Treasury Securities
There are three main U.S. federal government securities available to the buying public: Treasury bonds, Treasury notes and Treasury bills. These securities are issued with the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, but differ in the lengths of time they are issued and the manner in which they pay interest to investors.
Out of the three, Teasury bonds have the longest maturities of all government-issued securities, offered to investors with 20 or 30 year terms. Treasury bonds investors receive an interest payment every six months per the terms of the bond issue. Treasury notes have a shorter maturity rate than Treasury bonds and often have a one, five, seven or 10-year maturity dates.  The shorter maturity rates offer lower interest rates than Treasury bonds, but still offer interest payments. Banks and investors commonly use the 10-year Treasury note, a benchmark when calculating mortgage rates. Treasury bills have four set terms with which they can be issued: 13, 26 or 52 weeks. They offer the lowest yield of the three bond types, but are auctioned off to investors at a discount.
