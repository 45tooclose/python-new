Short sellers held 38 million shares in short bets against Tesla as of April 13, or more than 30% of the shares available for trading, Barron’s reports, a bug jump from 27 million shares in short bets last September.

Dire Outlook As Shorts Pile On
Traders shorting the stock are skeptical that Tesla can maintain its valuation as it runs through cash while trying to meet production goals. A recent Bloomberg analysis pegged Tesla's cash burn rate at more than $6,500 every 60 seconds.  (See also: Why Tesla is Burning Through Cash.)
Then there are those that have an even more critical outlook and expect the company to go bankrupt. Some worries have begun to emerge, especially in the wake of a recent downgrade of Tesla's debt rating by Moody’s Investor Services. Moody's also warned that Tesla's liquidity is not enough to cover its 2018 discretionary capital expenditure expected at $2 billion as well as another $1.2 billion in convertible debt that matures early next year.
At the end of last year, Tesla had $3.5 billion in cash and $9.4 billion in debt outstanding. It has raised money through traditional channels like selling stock and bonds, but it has benefited from a roughly $500 million loan from the U.S. Department of Energy in 2010.
More Trouble For Tesla?
Tesla has been trying to increase production on its mass-market Model 3 sedan but has been experiencing setbacks. CEO Elon Musk originally targeted a production rate of 5,000 cars per week by the end of 2017, but it has not even achieved half of that rate.

Tesla is scheduled to report earnings after the closing bell today. Analysts expect a loss of $3.54 per share, up from a loss of $1.33 per share in the first quarter of 2017.
The stock is down about 7% in the past year, but up about 13% in the past month. Over the last five years, Tesla has returned about 450% to shareholders, versus the S&P 500’s return of 66%.
