Additionally, its spreads on popular pairs such as the EURUSD will average 0.2 pips, while also supporting an unlimited number and volume of orders with no requotes and no commissions.MT5 Pro also bestows several other benefits as well including hedging and netting capabilities, in tandem with partial order filling policies. Of note, the platform supports twenty-one available timeframes and over thirty-eight technical indicators on offer.The new account constitutes one of several developments for FXTM in H1 2018. Earlier this year, FXTM saw the acquisition of a new FCA regulatory license. The license represented the third regulatory jurisdiction from which the company has acquired a permit.The company had previously been operating in the EU with a CySEC license and its move to diversify its portfolio comes after registering material growth in client numbers throughout 2017.
