        The decision to install the hotline came when Moon’s special envoys met Kim in Pyongyang last month to lay the groundwork for next week’s summit at the border village of Panmunjom. At last month’s meeting, Kim said he was hopeful that complicated conflicts could be resolved over a single phone call with Moon.South Korea’s Moon Warns Implementing Kim Deal Will Be Hard“It’s a very symbolic move and also an effective way to build mutual trust both military- and politics-wise,” said Shin Beomchul, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy. “It’ll prevent misunderstanding deriving from lack of communication and promote understanding of the two leaders.”In addition to several military hotlines, the two Koreas already have 33 active and inactive phone and fax lines, including five at Panmunjom and two for aviation control, according to the Unification Ministry.— With assistance by Jihye Lee
