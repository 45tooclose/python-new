      Seed stock refers to stocks issued by publicly traded companies that operate within the agriculture industry. These companies specialize in plant research and development. This research and development is generally aimed at producing greater yields from crops. Companies may develop and market specialized seeds, which have been engineered to withstand certain conditions, such as drought or the presence of pests. These companies also often hold patents for specific seeds and genes.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Seed Stock'
      Seed stock is often issued by companies that create seed for industrial level agricultural production. These crops include soy, corn, rice, and cotton. Each of these crops has a large global market and the seeds are often engineered for maximum yield.
Seed companies may also engineer crops for specific purposes. For example, a company may develop seed for a breed of corn intended only as livestock feed, and another only intended for the production of ethanol. These seeds would be necessarily different from corn seed intended for human consumption.
Examples of seed stocks
Examples of seed stocks include Monsanto, Syngenta AG and Origin Agritech. Origin Agritech was founded in 1997 in Beijing. Origin Agritech’s NASDAQ abbreviation is SEED, though it is only one of many seed stocks available globally. Monsanto is an American company that creates seeds and agricultural chemicals.
Monsanto holds more than 674 biotechnology patents, the most of any other U.S. company. Activist organizations concerned with the proliferation of genetically modified crops have centered much of their focus on Monsanto, which was profiled in part in the documentary film Food Inc. Monsanto responded to their portrayal in the film with a media statement and direct responses to questions from viewers and consumers.
Syngenta, another prominent global seed company, manufactures some neonicotinoid products. In April of 2018, the EU banned the use of these products except within greenhouses. The European Commission determined that neonicotinoids, which Syngenta uses to coat seeds to protect them from pests, are a threat to bee populations. Syngenta responded by stating it did not believe that the commission’s decision was the “right outcome for European farmers or for the environment.”
Other definitions of seed stock
Seed stock can also refer to startup capital that a company raises in order to establish itself. A company will sometimes sell a limited number of shares to investors in order to finance initial operations and growth. Investors then have a stake in the company based on their investment at the outset. This is also referred to as seed capital.
