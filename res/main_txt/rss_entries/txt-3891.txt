      Workable indication is a nominal quote expressed in the municipal bond market at which price a dealer is willing to either buy or sell a particular issue. This differs from a firm quote as revisions to the offer are allowed within a specified time period, usually one hour. In that way, a nominal quote expressed in the form of workable indication might be seen as an estimate or initial offer, or perhaps a starting point from which they can come to a mutually agreeable deal. With a firm quote, by contrast, the dealer must then follow through with the deal at the price quoted if the offer is accepted. Municipal bond dealers can also give out 'firm-with-recall' quotes that can be good for roughly the next hour, and then recalled.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Workable Indication'
      Workable indication is often expressed in a range, giving the seller the flexibility to adjust and allowing both parties some room to negotiate and go back and forth with specific figures. This strategy is used in a more casual context, when the dealer or broker is in the initial stage of trying to make a deal, and may be still trying to feel the potential buyer out to gauge their interest or assess their comfort level with various price levels. It may often be delivered in non-committal terms, using relatively vague language, such as “It’s somewhere in the neighborhood of…” or “I think it would probably be roughly around…”
Workable indication as part of the bond trading market
To fully appreciate how a workable indication tactic might be used in a bond trading scenario, it is helpful to understand the atmosphere in which this activity typically takes place. Municipal bonds are usually traded within a secondary or interdealer market and are purchased by banks, bond funds, insurance companies, other institutional investors, individual investors and small businesses.
Whereas in the stock market things tend to happen at a fast pace, with frantic bursts of activity and the pressure to make quick decisions, the municipal bond market is generally more relaxed, and participants aren’t under the same kind of intense pressure to make quick decisions. As a result, they can haggle and mull over the offer while trying to negotiate for the best possible deal. However, there is always the possibility that another potential buyer will swoop in and express interest. Then the scenario may get more competitive, and buyers may need to increase their offer and make a quick decision.
