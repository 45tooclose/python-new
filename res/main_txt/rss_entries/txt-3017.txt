  Bitcoin (BTC) showed its ability to preserve price levels, only dipping once to $8,800 before recovering the $9,000 levels. However, Bitcoin trading activity suddenly sank, from habitual levels of around 36% of all deals to about 30%, as altcoins stole the show.

Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to $9.328.07, up around 5% in the past day, netting a 10% gain this week. The price dominance of BTC fluctuates all the time, falling to 37.7% as altcoins picked up the pace ahead of the weekend. Tethers (USDT) trading expanded to more than 15% of deals, while affecting several altcoins as well. The Japanese Yen is responsible for more than 54% of BTC trading. Volumes remain steady at around $7 billion in 24 hours.

Study: Bitcoin Futures Curve Flat in Q1, Signs of Backwardation Emerge




Ethereum (ETH) is getting more evidence of ICOs keeping the price depressed, as more projects have liquidated part of their holdings to fund developments. ETH climbed by 17% this week, to $680.20, but still not achieving anything close to a vertical climb.
Ripple (XRP) had an exciting week with a low-ball selling order that crashed the market. However, XRP managed to recover to $0.83, while hopes of multi-dollar prices continue. XRP is almost flat this week.
Bitcoin Cash (BCH, BCC) once again stole the spotlight, and was one of the strongest climbers, as it excited panic buying. However, BCH slid from the $1,500 levels quickly, settling for a net weekly gain of 36%. BCH moved to $1,402.07, after adding a more subdued 5% in the past day. However, BCH is seeing more bullish attitudes, and possibly a price of $3,000 at the next big rally.
EOS (EOS) continued its climb, boosted by the process of node creator candidacies. EOS grew by 59% this week to $16.28 as interest in trading accelerated. EOS has less than 40 days to the mainnet launch, with a possibility to continue the price rally.

Litecoin (LTC), displaced by EOS, remained habitually steady, with a net change of 2.9% since last week, at $152.71. The Korbit listing and trading did little for LTC prices.
Stellar (XLM) is getting more active by the day, rising above $0.40 with predictions of $1 prices. XLM added a net 11% this week, to $0.41.
Cardano (ADA) is drifting sideways, not picking up a trend, as the asset was overhyped a few months back, and now fails to incite interest. ADA grew by about 3% this week, to $0.29, still keeping much of the gains.
IOTA (MIOTA) remains on the sidelines, but keeps up the pace. MIOTA added around 10% and toward the end of the week appreciated to $2.07.
NEO (NEO) hovers at $76.90 as interest has waned a bit, up just 2.9% this week. Traders have moved to cheaper assets, and NEO has no room for growth. NEO is on the verge of a “flippening” with TRON, which gained speed this week.
TRON (TRX) became the most mentioned crypto asset on Twitter, and may enter the Top 10 of coins at any time. TRX added a net 47% to its price, rising to $0.074.
Monero (XMR) is at $263.16, looking at an upcoming hard fork at the end of the month. XMR added just 5% this week, as interest has waned.
DASH (DASH) is adding value slowly, growing by about 12% in the past seven days to $493.22. A return to $1,000 prices may be slow to come.
NEM (XEM) inched up to $0.40, up about 4% this week, but the coin has returned to a relatively obscure position.
As altcoin season came along, the search for more exotic coins, which were still sleepers, accelerated price gains. OmiseGo (OMG) touched $20 and seems robust enough to keep the gains and continue upward. Other assets made dramatic speculative moves: ZClassic (ZCL) is once again entering danger territory on expectations of three-digit prices soon.
