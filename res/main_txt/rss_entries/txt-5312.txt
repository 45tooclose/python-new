However, these brokers are not for beginner traders – they are for the Big Boys in trading, the sophisticated traders.

Pricing And Fees
TradeStation
Stocks and ETFs: Tradestation has a variety of different options with how one pays for commissions fees. For stocks, there are three options. The first is a flat fee of $5.00 per trade. Another option is per-share fees. If you regularly trade in smaller blocks than you can save even more by paying fees using a per-share cost of $0.01. The last option for stocks and ETFs is the Unbundled alternative. This option allows traders completing high volume trades to gain execution rebates, trimming your cost to as low as $0.002/per-share with the capability to participate in liquidity rebates.
Options: Tradestation fees for options trading work quite simply. The starts at $0.50 per contract and a $5.00 fee per trade. If you trade in smaller blocks, then you have the option for a different pricing plan. The other option of a per-contract fee of $1.00 per contract without a base/ticket charge. The minimum is one contract market or limit.
 
Futures: The way Tradestations futures work is a $1.50 fee per contract per side. The price you pay per contract, per side is relative to the number of trades you make in a month. The more contracts traded in a month, the lower your fees become. There is also a Futures+ Platform designed for futures options trades which offers the same $1.50 per contract, per side for futures options and futures contracts as well but explicitly traded through the Futures+ platform.

Other fees, such as exchange execution and clearing fees by markets, apply to TradeStation futures trading, depending on the exchange membership level of the trader (e.g. on treasuries, non-members pay $0.65 and proprietary traders pay $0.30) on the CBOT.
Forex currencies: Trade forex currencies on TradeStation commission free because it makes its money on the tight spreads on currency trades. Active traders and institutional clients get even better execution, liquidity and spreads, with spreads as low as 1 pip (e.g. spreads move from 1.6 pip for EUR/USD for retail pricing, down to 1.0 pip for EUR/USD for active trader pricing). RadarScreen is free of charge for forex-only accounts and does not incur $99.95 account service fees.
Bonds and mutual funds: Bonds trade for a base rate of $14.95 per trade plus $5.00 per bond and T-bills trade for a flat rate of $50 per trade.  Mutual funds trade for a base rate of $14.95 per trade plus any fund-specific fee that may apply.
TradeStation may charge a monthly account service fee of $99.95 if traders do not maintain a certain minimum trading volume in the preceding month (such as 50 equities and ETF option contracts, 5,000 stocks or ETF shares or 10 round-turn futures or futures options contracts or 50 round-turns of single stock futures) or an account balance of $100,000 at the end of the prior month (except forex-only accounts). The first 10 option contract cancelations are free of charge so long as the total cancelations do not exceed the number of orders for the day on the per-contract commission pricing. The per-share pricing has no cancelation fees.
Interactive Brokers, also referred to as “IB”: IB mainly works with two pricing schemes: fixed commission plan and tiered commission plan.  The fixed plan is a flat rate for each transaction (e.g. per trade or per contract) and is inclusive (e.g. VAT, exchange and regulatory fees are included). Not all fees are included in the fixed rate commission, rather some (e.g. transaction fees) are passed along to the trader. The tiered commission plan is a non-inclusive plan whereas exchange, regulatory and clearing fees, as well as VAT are “add-ons,” and is inversely related to the number of contracts or the volume traded (decreasing as the transaction value increases). Savings passed along to the traders include a share of the rebates from the exchanges. (For additional reading, refer to Interactive Brokers: Commission, Fees And Customer Support).
IB targets seasoned, well-funded active traders and trading institutions (such as hedge funds and proprietary trading firms). This is reflected in its high minimum account opening balance requirement (e.g. $10,000 in the US and most other markets, and an equivalent of $5,000 in India) and its minimum monthly activity requirement of $10 in monthly commission. Failing to meet these requirements results in an activity fee equal to the difference between the $10 minimum and the actual commission attained.
Stocks, ETFs and warrants:  In North America, IB’s fixed commission is USD 0.005 per share in the US and CAD 0.01 per share in Canada, with a 1.00 local dollar minimum and a maximum of 1.0% of the trade value; in Mexico, the fixed rate is 0.1% of the trade value, with MXN 60 per share minimum and no maximum. In Europe, the fixed commission is usually 0.1% of the trade value for both euro- and US dollar-denominated investments, with EUR 4.00 per share minimum in a majority of markets (e.g. Austria, Germany, Belgium and France) and varying maximum commissions. Some exceptions apply, where fixed commission in the Nordic countries (Sweden and Norway) is 0.05% of the trade value and in the UK is the base rate of GBP 6.00 for up to GBP 50,000 in trade value, and for a transaction exceeding GBP 50,000, GBP 6.00 base rate applies to the first GBP 50,000 plus 0.05% of the incremental trade value over GBP 50,000. In Asia Pacific (Japan, Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong), the fixed commission is 0.08% of the trade value with varying minimums (e.g. AUD 6.00, NZD 8.00, SGD 2.50, JPY 80.00 and HKD 18.00 for stocks, HKD 10.00 for warrants and structured products, and CNH 15.00 for Shanghai-Hong Kong connected stocks), with no maximum.
A tiered commission, as explained before, drops as the trade value (or shares) increases; unlike the fixed rate, both rebates and fees from the exchanges are passed along to traders. The tiered commission, based on the number of traded shares per month, ranges from USD 0.0035, down to USD 0.0005 in the US, and from CAD 0.008, down to USD 0.003 in Canada, with a maximum commission of 0.5% of the trade value plus applicable clearing and transaction fees. The tiered pricing is illustrated in the table below.

In Europe, the tiered commission is based on the currency (EUR, SEK, NOK and GBP) value traded per month (not the number of shares), with the following minimum commissions: EUR 1.25, CHF 1.50 and USD 1.70, and the following maximum commissions: EUR 29.00, CHF 49.00 and USD 39.00 for the respective currency-denominated investments. The UK and Nordic countries (Sweden and Norway) have minimum commissions of GBP 1.00 and SEK/NOK 10.00, and no maximum commissions. The tiered commission structure in Europe is illustrated in the table below.

Currency Margin: The requirements range from a low 2.5% (leveraged 40 to 1) for very liquid and stable currencies such as USD, GBP and CAD to a high 20% (leveraged 5 to 1) for volatile currencies such as the Russian rubble (RUB).
Bonds: Corporate bonds and municipal bonds (munis) trade in the US at the tiered commission rate of 10 bps or 0.10% of the face value of USD 10,000 (or less) and at the rate of 2.5 bps of the face value of more than USD 10,000 in principal. Treasuries transact at the tiered rate of 2.5 bps of the face value of USD 1 million (or less) in principal and at the rate of 0.5 bps of the face value of more than USD 1 million. The minimum commission for all bond trades is USD 5.00. We recommend that traders familiarize themselves with IB’s website for bond commissions in foreign currencies (e.g. HKD and EUR).
Metal Commodities (gold and silver): They trade on fixed commission rates of 0.15 bps of the monthly value, with $2.00 minimum per transaction. The annual storage cost of physical assets is 10 bps.
Contract for Difference (CFD): The non-index IB CFDs trade at the tiered rate, whereas the US tiered commission rate ranges from $0.0050 (with $1.00 minimum) for a monthly volume of $300,000 (or less), down to $0.0030 (with $0.65 minimum) for a monthly volume of more than $100 million. Meanwhile, the US and North American IB Index CFD contracts trade at fixed rates as follows: the US500 index is priced at 0.005% of the value per trade, the US30 index is priced at 0.005% of the value per trade and the US Tech 500 index is priced at 0.010% of the value per trade, all with a minimum commission of $1.00 per transaction. It is recommended that traders familiarize themselves with IB’s website for CFD commissions in foreign currencies (e.g. JPY and EUR). (For related reading, refer to An Introduction To CFDs).
Mutual Funds: IB trades no-load mutual funds in the US only at the fixed flat rate of $14.95 per trade (no tiered pricing in the US), with an initial minimum of $3,000. The European funds trade both at the fixed rate and at the tiered commission rate. The fixed rate is 0.10% of the monthly trade value, with a EUR 4.00 minimum and EUR 29.00 maximum commission per transaction. The tiered commission rate, only applicable to European funds, ranges from 0.080% for a monthly value of EUR 1 million (or less), down to 0.015% for a monthly value of more than EUR 500 million, with EUR 1.25 minimum and EUR 29.00 maximum commission per transaction. (For related reading, refer to What's the difference between a load and no-load mutual fund?).
Broker-Assisted Trades (only in the US) are priced as follows: Stocks and ETFs at $0.01 per share with $100 minimum, options at $0.95 per contract with $95 minimum, and futures and options on futures at $3.00 per contract with $300 minimum.
Interactive Brokers is ripe with many types of fees that traders need to be aware of (e.g. $500 trade bust/adjustment fee with the CME Group), and thus it is highly recommended that readers visit its website to familiarize themselves with IB’s extensive fees and pricing structure both in US dollars and foreign currencies (e.g. CHF). Mastery of the fee structure can play to traders’ advantage. For instance, traders subscribed to the non-professional market data package who transact at least $30 in commission per month will have the $10 cost waived off, which is also waived off in the first three months for an account with a net balance of $100,000.
Investment Products and Market Access
TradeStation: Trade all the primary investment products: equities (stocks and ETFs), options, futures, fixed income bonds, T-bills, currencies and mutual funds at multiple exchanges. For a spread, traders can transact CFDs on commodities without any commission, and trade OTC microchip and penny stocks via the OTCBB.
Interactive Brokers: IB provides all the investment products that are available on TradeStation and some [including indices, single stock futures, futures on options, structured products, forex currencies, CFDs, warrants, metals commodities, callable bull/bear contract (CBBCS)]. One of the prominent features of Interactive Brokers is that it gives traders access to 100 market centers in 24 countries (e.g. the US, Canada, Mexico, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, the UK, France, Sweden and Japan) and a wide variety of tradable products. IB has one of the most versatile investment offerings among  online brokerage firms. It has a marketplace where clients can access independent advisers for a fee. 
Technology, Market Data and Research
TradeStation: It is recognized by in the industry for having some of the best tools and technologies traders can have at their disposal. Trade at home, office and on-the-go on desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets and the web. It provides highly customizable trading platforms (TradeStation and OptionStation) that enable advanced charting, option and Greek calculators, quick trade bar and sophisticated order-entry tools that enable complex option positions. The platforms allow traders to set up macros and keyboard short-cuts and preferred windows. Portfolio Maestro is a tool used for strategy back-testing and portfolio optimization. RadarScreen is a sophisticated fee-based tool that scans the market for opportunities and ranks them to assist the trader, and thus is highly recommended. TradeStation Labs is a team of analysts that assists traders to master the platform and provides insightful research and analysis. Recognia is an advanced technical charting tool that analyzes tens of thousands of investment products (equities, futures and currencies) at exchanges across the globe to identify the patterns of emerging opportunities for traders.
Interactive Brokers: IB also provides a very advanced platform and tools for sophisticated traders. Probability Labs and Option Calculator help options traders visualize the option mechanics and assist them in computing and analyzing option profit, Greeks and option probability distribution, including scenario analysis. Option Strategies Widget assists traders in the creation and testing of various option strategies. Traders get access to research, news feeds and market data from both Interactive Brokers Information System "IBIS" (own research and news service provider) and other vendors for a fee. IB Risk Navigator is a free tool that aids traders in managing risk from a portfolio perspective. Volatility Lab assists traders in mapping out historical, forward-looking and implied volatility profiles and skews. The PortfolioAnalyst tool performs periodic analysis (including comparative analysis of the S&P 500) across the various asset classes in the account based on the portfolio structure and risk/return characteristics. (For related reading, refer to Creating Automated Trading Systems Using Interactive Brokers: Automated Trading With Interactive Brokers).
Competitive Edge: TradeStation’s core competitive advantage lies in its advanced technologies and tools that it makes available on its trading platform that rivals the very best (e.g.  TD Ameritrade’s Thinkorswim). (For related reading, refer to Beginner's Guide To Thinkorswim Trading Platform). TradeStation’s platform is among the most versatile and customizable systems, based primarily on the TWS system. Meanwhile, Interactive Brokers’ competitiveness centers on access to about 100 international markets across 24 countries, and to a very diverse pool of investments products. IB’s ultra-low margin rates are very attractive to short sellers, futures traders and institutional groups (e.g. proprietary trading firms). A unique feature of IB is its investors’ marketplace that matches traders with various service providers (such as independent brokers and advisers, hedge funds, money managers, education and research providers, and others). Another key advantage of Interactive Brokers is that it is known for delivering value price improvement through its Smart-Router. Options traders can direct their smart-routed orders of non-marketable securities to an exchange that offers the best rebate or liquidity.
Suitability: These brokers are neither ideal nor recommended for beginners who will most certainly find themselves dazed with these very advanced platforms that require a steep learning curve and the complex fee structure. TradeStation is the best for sophisticated and institutional traders who can best use its advanced technologies, willing to pay for value-added tools and research, and can comprehend and effectively navigate its fees and pricing schemes to their advantage. Again, Interactive Brokers is most suitable for sophisticated traders who can pay for its tools and research (mostly provided by third parties), and can find value in paying for its various services, navigate its very complex fee structure to their advantage as well as can afford and find value in its services on the whole. Most importantly, IB is best suited for traders who value diversification of investment products and access to international markets. 
The Bottom Line
These brokerage firms target the same clientele (seasoned, well-funded and active traders) with few differences, and this is evidenced by their minimum monthly activity fees mentioned above. Day traders and institutional traders who can trade the necessary volume, have the skills to maximize the value of the tools and products from these brokers, and can minimize the average costs will benefit the most from these brokerage firms. Due to the complexity of the platforms and burdensome fees, these brokers may be detrimental to new and inexperienced traders, infrequent traders and those who are not well funded to take advantage of the pricing schemes. These brokers attract traders with the promise of advanced tools and greater access to markets and investment choices, including international exchanges, and not on the basis of simple and cheap pricing structure or attractive promotions. As both brokers are riddled with numerous and complex fees, traders should spend sufficient time to familiarize themselves. Interactive Brokers has an especially complex fee and pricing structure. Given the complexity of these fees, we recommend traders to visit each broker’s website and extensively study the pricing and fee structures.
