      A coiled market is a market that has the potential to make a strong move in one direction after being pushed in the opposite direction or held flat. The idea is that if a market should be headed in one direction due to its fundamentals but is pushed in the other direction, it will eventually make a strong move in the original fundamental direction. This coiled move will often be more substantial than what might have been the case if it had gone in the expected direction to begin with.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Coiled Market'
      Coiled markets often arise when the market has been held down artificially. This happens in commodities markets, such as gold and silver. Investors looking to capitalize on coiled markets will use both fundamental and technical analysis to identify markets or specific equities that exhibit the characteristics of a coiled market. 
Technical analysts refer to triangle patterns on charts as coils. As the upper and lower parts of the triangle move closer together and the more psychological energy coils up like a spring inside the triangle as the lines move closer together, the bigger the breakout will be theoretically. At some point, prices will move outside of the triangle's boundaries. The question is whether they'll move higher or lower.
Example of a Coiled Market
A good example of a coiled market is a government that intervenes in its currency. Market observers often point to China when talking about the potential for a coiled yuan market. That is because the Chinese government has a penchant for putting certain controls on the yuan, namely keeping it artificially low relative to fair market values. If the government were to lift the controls it placed on the currency, the yuan would likely increase at a rapid rate. 
However, the rebound on a coiled market is not always higher. The market for the pound became coiled in the other direction leading up to September 16, 1992, otherwise known as Black Wednesday. That day, a collapse in the pound sterling forced Britain to withdraw from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, or ERM. The ERM was introduced in the late 1970s to stabilize European currencies in preparation for the Economic and Monetary Union and the introduction of the euro. Countries seeking to replace their currency with the euro were required to keep the value of their currency within a certain range for a number of years.
