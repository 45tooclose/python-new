        Relations between the U.S. and Russia have deteriorated sharply this spring. Earlier this month, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on several Russian tycoons and companies close to President Vladimir Putin under provisions of a law passed last year to retaliate against Moscow for interring in the election.Sanctions and Expulsions“The Russian government engages in a range of malign activity around the globe," Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said then. He cited Moscow’s occupation of Crimea and its role in supplying weapons and other aid to the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.Days before the sanctions were announced, the U.S., along with other Western countries, also expelled scores of Russian diplomats in response to accusations that the Kremlin was behind the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in the U.K.And last Friday -- together with the Britain and France -- the U.S. launched missile strikes on Syrian targets after the Assad government was accused of attacking a rebel-held town with chemical weapons.
