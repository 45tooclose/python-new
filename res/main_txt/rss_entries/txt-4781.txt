      A sinker is a bond with payments that are provided by the issuer's sinking fund. A sinker bond has interest and principal payments stemming from the proceeds of a sinking fund.
A sinking fund is  a fund that has regular money deposits made into is on a regular basis, basically as a way to boost investor confidence in the fund. Seeing money into the fund on a regular basis helps the investor have confidence that the promised payments will be made and that the sinking fun can be used to redeem debt securities or preferred stock issues.
A sinker's bond payments are paid from a pool of money that the issuer has set aside to repurchase a portion of the bonds it has issued each year. By repurchasing some bonds before they mature, the company avoids the large expense of repaying the bonds' entire principal at once, when the bonds reach their original maturity date.
Why the term sunk? A sinker bond works by having the bond issuer create a dedicated fund that has set sums paid off over time; the portions of the outstanding issue that are paid off are called sunk.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Sinker'
      A sinker theoretically has a lower default risk at maturity, since the issuer intends to retire early a portion of the bonds it has issued. However, it also has reinvestment risks similar to those of a callable bond because, if interest rates decline, the investor could have the bond repurchased by the issuer at either the sinking fund price or the current market price.
There are sinker bonds and then there are super sinker bonds. Super sinker bonds are generally home financing bonds, but the term can also be applied to any type of bond with long-term coupons and short maturity.
If a super sinker bond is referring to a home mortgage, it might be a pre-paid mortgage that allows the mortgage holder to get a long-term yield after a short period of time.
The advantage of Sinker Bonds
Sinker bonds have an advantage over other periodic-redemption bonds because it allows investors to know exactly when they get their money back. Sinkers clearly set how much you’ll get back when, so the risk of a mortgage-backed bond being sold or refinanced without you knowledge is lowered. Additionally, every payment to the sink date lowers an investor’s exposure to credit and interest rate risk.
