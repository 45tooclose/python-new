      BREAKING DOWN 'Farmer Mac - Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation - FAMC'
      Farmer Mac, the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, was chartered by Congress to issue debt securities and invest the cash flow from these sales in loan purchases and Farmer Mac guaranteed securities such as agricultural mortgage-backed securities, or AMBs. The broader goal of Farmer Mac is to foster a secondary market for agricultural real estate and rural housing loans, and to support the availability of long-term credit for American farmers, ranchers and rural homeowners.
Farmer Mac’s function within the marketplace is similar to that of other government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. By purchasing retail loans, repackaging them into marketable securities, and supporting the market for those securities, these GSEs bring global capital to broaden the pool of qualified buyers for real estate or other assets. The loan insurance provided by these GSEs also serve this end. These efforts lead to the availability of lower interest rates for retail borrowers, and cost savings over the life of a loan.
Farmer Mac debt securities and AMBS
Farmer Mac issues a variety of debt securities, including discount notes, floating-rate medium-term notes, and callable notes. These securities are not guaranteed by the federal government and are not associated with the Farm Credit System. Farmer Mac also issues agricultural mortgage-backed securities that are backed by either farm and ranch loans or portions of loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Like other GSEs, Farmer Mac eases the borrowing process and costs for agricultural borrowers. This creates significant risk for the agency, especially in times of financial crisis. Widespread mortgage defaults put stress on Farmer Mac’s ability to guarantee loans. Higher interest rates can also lead to higher repayment risk and strains on Farmer Mac’s ability to cover loans. These conditions led to Farmer Mac’s founding in the early 1980s. A combination of decreased farm income and increased interest rates led to a crisis among agricultural borrowers. Congress responded by passing the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 which created Farmer Mac.
In 2008, Farmer Mac’s investment in Fannie Mae shares and Lehman Brothers Holdings led to significant losses. This forced the Farm Credit System and Zions Bancorporation, among other investors from the financial sector, to bail Farmer Mac out through a stock purchase worth over $65 million.
