Xetra and Electronic Trading Systems
In 1969 the first automated system for direct trading among U.S. institutions launched, Instinet (originally named Institutional Networks). Nasdaq followed in 1971. This began as an automated quotation system where trading occurred over the phone although broker-dealers were able to see the prices other firms were offering.The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) subsequently launched their Designated Order Turnaround (DOT) system. This allowed brokers to route orders directly to specialists on the floor. In 1984, SuperDOT emerged, expanding the number of shares sent to the floor at one time to nearly 100,000. Nasdaq soon offered the Small Order Execution System (SOES) to compete with NYSE.  
Today electronic trading dominates the public markets; however with greater connectivity comes greater cybersecurity threats. While individuals remain at some level of cyber-attack risk, larger entities such as businesses and government systems are often the main targets. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security uses high-tech cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive government information from other countries, nation-states, and individual hackers. Any financial system that stores credit card information from its users is at a high risk; along with systems like exchanges.
