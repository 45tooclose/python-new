      A bond violation is a breach of the terms of a surety agreement. A bond violation occurs when a surety bond, which protects one party against a financial loss caused by the other party's failure to perform, fails to meet the conditions of the agreement. In more general terms, a bond violation is the failure to act or acting in a contrary way in a contract.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Bond Violation'
      An example of a bond violation might occur is the owner of a shopping center who hires a contractor to perform a seismic retrofit of the building might require the contractor to purchase a surety bond. If the contractor's work fails to bring the building into compliance with current earthquake construction codes as stipulated in the surety bond, the contractor has failed to perform and thus committed a bond violation. In the event of the bond violation in this example, the surety company would pay the shopping center owner for this loss. The surety company would then collect that sum from the contractor. The surety bond guarantees that the shopping center owner gets their money even if the contractor can't pay. The surety arrangement reduces the shopping center owner's risk in the project and the contractor.
Contractor bonds and bond violations
In the United States, most states require contractors to obtain a contractor bond as a guarantee to potential clients that they will meet specific standards of operation relative to their industry. A contractor bond is a protection for residential or commercial customers against outright fraud or against workmanship that is below industry standards. Performance bonds ensure that a contractor fulfills the terms of a contract, while a contractor license bond ensures that the contractor will comply with state or local licensing requirements.
In legal terms, a contractor bond is a binding contract between three parties, a principal, an obligor, and a surety. The principal is the contractor who is seeking the bond for his business, the obligor is the organization imposing the bond requirement on the contractor, and the surety is an insurance company that guarantees the contractorâ€™s obligations. In the event of any claim, the surety company would pay the amount of the claim, but would then be reimbursed by the principal.
It is preferable for contractor to meet the terms of any rules or regulations that apply rather than to allow a situation to develop into a claim of a bond violation. When that happens, an obligor would seek financial restitution in lieu of unfulfilled terms, and the surety would have to pay the bond amount as well as any legal costs involved. Those costs then would be passed through to the principal, who could suffer a business setback.
