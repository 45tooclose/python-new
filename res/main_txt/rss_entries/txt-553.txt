Previously, “on March 11, two policemen — Anisuddin Saiyed and Chintan Shah were arrested for abducting a businessman and demanding ransom from him in bitcoins.”The officers have been accused of kidnapping three individuals, including renowned businessman Shailesh Bhatt. The officers took the men to a farm in a remote location, beat them, and forced them to transfer 200 Bitcoins (worth roughly US$1.37 million or INR₹89,132,040 at press time.)An Unfortunate TrendThe report also listed several other incidences that have occurred throughout the country over the last year. “Last June, a group of six people [were] arrested on the charge of abducting and demanding ransom in bitcoins from a businessman in the northern city of Mohali. In September, police had arrested six other persons for kidnapping, beating and robbing a New Delhi businessman who had gone to meet them in order to pay for Bitcoin in cash.”While Bitcoin is not quite as anonymous as most people seem to think that it is, the currency’s association with criminal activity and privacy make it an attractive option for thieves.When using Bitcoin, “you can preserve your privacy as long as the pseudonym is not linked to you. But as soon as somebody makes the link to one of your anonymous books, the ruse is revealed. Your entire writing history under your pseudonym becomes public,” reads a report from the MIT technology review.The digital wallets of the victims of the latest crypto-related robbery in India will be “scrutinized” to find evidence that may lead officials to other individuals involved in the crime. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: Bitcoin Crime / blockchain / crime / cryptocurrencies / indiaRelated News First Soros Invests in Cryptocurrency and Now Rockefeller – Is Buffett Next?
