Some see it as a competitor.We published an analysis of EOS in February looking at whether it really is any different to competitors such as Ethereum, Lisk and NEO. Bitfinex CEO Jan Ludovicus van der Velde certainly thinks it is; he called it “fundamentally transformative” and launched a decentralised exchange called EOSfinex in partnership with the company.One thing that is different is that it uses a consensus system called delegated proof of stake, which very basically means that blocks are approved by elected representatives instead of everyone, which is the case with the problematic proof of work system still used by Ethereum. DPOS is used by companies such as Lisk and Tezos.Another unique point is that the price of the tokens is set by market demand, not set as is usually the case. They have averaged a price of $4.42.I found it worrying that the EOS whitepaper began by saying that its operator “does not guarantee the accuracy of or the conclusions reached in this white paper” and that it will “have no liability for damages of any kind arising out of the use, reference to, or reliance on this white paper or any of the content contained herein”. However EOS seems to be doing very well.According to Brave New Coin, its uniquely organised complicated ICO is raking in cash – it has so far raised 5,148,884.15 ETH, which is 5.2% of all ETH currently available.The ICO is split into 23 hour-long sessions organised in multiple phases. The first phase of the sale began in June 2017, and raised $185 million within the first 5 days.EOS has a market capitalisation of almost $7 billion according to coinmarketcap.com, with the majority of trading occurring on OKEX, Huobi, Bitfinex, Bithumb, and Binance. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: Analysis / Bitfinex / EOS / Ethereum / ICORelated News Cloud Mining Put to the Test- Is It Worth Your Money?
