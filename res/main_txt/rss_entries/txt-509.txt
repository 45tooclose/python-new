Fraud among cryptocurrency investment promoters is widespread, the state regulator most active in the crypto arena warned today. 
Of 32 cryptocurrency investment promoters investigated in four weeks, at least five failed to tell would-be investors about the risks and guaranteed returns of up to 40 percent a month, the Texas State Securities Board cautioned. 
Nearly two-thirds of the promoters did not provide investors with a physical address. 
Without a physical location, the Board warned investors may not be able to locate a promoter to serve it with legal process or attempt to pursue other remedies once they have been defrauded. 
A report from the regulator noted many cryptocurrency solicitations played on Bitcoinâ€™s sharp increase in price, even though the investment being marketed to investors had nothing to do with the most famous brand in digital currencies. 
 
  
Left unsaid in promotions, said the report, is the prospect of hackers penetrating security systems and disrupting an investment program or absconding with cryptocurrencies. 
The Board said investors should not be lulled into a false sense of confidence in promoters by handsome photographs and glowing vitae on their websites.
