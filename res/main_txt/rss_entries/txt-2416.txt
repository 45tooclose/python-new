Revolut, which describes itself as ‘the digital banking alternative’, has today raised an additional $250 million in Series C funding. 
This means the London-based FinTech has increased its valuation by 500% in less than a year to give it a post-funding valuation of $1.7 billion. 
This makes it one of the fastest tech companies in Europe to reach so-called unicorn status. 
The new Series C round was led by Hong Kong-based DST Global alongside a portfolio of new and existing investors including other blue-ribbon Silicon Valley investors, Index Ventures and Ribbit Capital. T 
The latest round of funding brings the total amount raised by Revolut to $340 million since the company launched three years ago. 
According to the company, Revolut now processes $1.8 billion through the platform each month and is signing up between 6,000 and 8,000 new customers every day. 
 
  
It now has two million customers in total and has announced an ambitious target of acquiring 100 million customers in the next five years.
