      A constant ratio plan is a strategic asset allocation strategy, or formula, which keeps the aggressive and conservative portions of a portfolio set at a fixed ratio. To maintain the target weights — typically of stocks and bonds — the portfolio is periodically rebalanced by selling outperforming assets and buying underperforming ones. Thus, stocks are sold if they rise faster than other investments and bought if they fall in value more than the other investments in the portfolio.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Constant Ratio Plan'
      A constant ratio plan is an example of a long-term formula investing strategy, that does not involve security analysis and forecasting, or market timing. It is able to leverage active-like management qualities through systematic rebalancing according to a prescribed formula, as the market rises and falls. When the actual ratio differs from the desired ratio by a predetermined amount, transactions are made to rebalance the portfolio. Constant ratio plans, together with constant dollar value plans, are similar to buy and hold asset allocation strategies used in portfolio management, except that buy and hold strategies never rebalance.
The cost of these rebalancing transactions reduces investment returns. But constant ratio plans aim to smooth out investment returns over a longer time horizon by adjusting the portfolio counter-cyclically, and taking profits on speculative stocks that have rallied strongly. By selling outperforming stocks and buying underperforming ones, constant ratio plans run counter to momentum investing strategies that sell underperforming assets and buy outperforming ones. This is why they work best in volatile markets with a general mean-reverting pattern.
Smart Beta ETFs Are Another Form of Formula Investing
Because capitalization weighted indices sometimes overweight overvalued stocks and underweight undervalued ones at the peak of bull markets, some smart beta exchange traded funds are also counter-cyclical — targeting factors like momentum, volatility, value and size — by systematically overweighting or underweighting them.
