Salesforce is working on a product based on blockchain technology, the cloud computing company's CEO has revealed.
Marc Benioff, who founded the company in 1999, revealed the news when speaking to Business Insider's Julie Bort at the TrailheaDX Salesforce Developer Conference on March 28 (check out the video below).
Benioff said he'd begun to hone in on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency after an encounter at a hotel bar in Davos, Switzerland, in January. The World Economic Forum he was attending coincided with a cryptocurrency conference, and a conversation with one of that event's attendees led Benioff to consider the ways his company could integrate the technology.
"I had been thinking a lot about what is Salesforce's strategy around blockchain, and what is Salesforce's strategies around cryptocurrencies and how we relate to all of these things," he said. 

After the Davos conversation, Benioff told Bort, he came to the realization:
"You know if you do this, this and this, you could put blockchain and cryptocurrencies into Salesforce."
While not providing details on the upcoming product, Benioff said that he hopes to "have a blockchain and cryptocurrency solution for Salesforce and for all of our customers" before Dreamforce - a conference the company will host in San Francisco from Sept. 25 to 28.
Salesforce is best-known for its cloud computing software for customer relationship management. The company made $10.5 billion in revenue in the year ending Jan. 31.
