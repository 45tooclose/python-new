      BREAKING DOWN 'Airport Revenue Bond'
      An airport revenue bond is tax-exempt and is typically issued when a municipality or airport is looking to expand its facilities or pay for upgrades. Airport revenue bonds are the most common form of airport debt. Because a municipality or airport authority issues the debt, it is more likely to have a lower interest rate, making the long-term financing costs for the airport lower.
The tax-exempt status of an airport revenue bond may depend on the airport's mix of public and private use. The more an airport is used for private purposes rather than public, the less likely the bond will offer the full extent of tax-exempt options. Credit analysts rate airport revenue bonds on the amount of traffic the airport receives, how well the airport performs financially and how likely it is that airlines will continue to use the facility.
Other Kinds of Municipal Revenue Bonds
When the revenue of a specific project, such as a toll road, a recycling plant, or local stadium supports a municipal bond, it is called a revenue bond. Revenue bonds are municipal bonds that finance income-producing projects and are secured by a specified revenue source. Government agencies that are managed as businesses can issue revenue bonds.
Different from general obligation bonds, bonds that can be repaid through a variety of tax sources, revenue bonds are backed by the revenue streams created by the specific project. Whereas holders of GO bonds must rely on the full credit of the issuing municipality. Because the entire credit and taxing power of the issuing jurisdiction backs a GO bond, no assets are used as collateral. Revenue bonds have a higher risk than GO bonds, but because of that they can sometimes pay a higher rate of interest.
For example, in the case of an airport revenue bond, the municipality issues a bond to build a new terminal. The bond depends on the airport to back it, and once the terminal is completed the new airport landing fees, terminal rents, concession revenue, parking charges etc. will generate revenue that the city will use to pay off the bond.
There are numerous kinds of municipal revenue bonds, as many as the kind of projects they fund. The most common besides the airport revenue bond are housing revenue, which help finance the construction of affordable housing, student loan revenue bonds, highway revenue bonds and transit revenue bonds.
