        Attendees at a separate fireside chat at the Montage got a vice presidential briefing on trade, immigration, health care and North Korea’s Kim Jong-Un, said billionaire Tom Barrack, the Colony NorthStar Inc. chairman who hosted that event.“The idea was to have a non-political function and let some of our friends in L.A. who are not necessarily supporters of the president get a look at the man who is one breath away,” Barrack said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “Los Angeles is a place where when you talk about Kim, they think it’s Kardashian.”The Milken conference, attracting some 5,000 of the world’s richest, most powerful people, has become a key target for political fundraisers looking to piggyback on the event. The interest is particularly keen this year as Democrats look to retake the U.S. House of Representatives from the GOP.14 FundraisersThe conference, which traces its roots to the 1980s when Michael Milken was the king of junk bonds at Drexel Burnham Lambert, has always been about dealmaking. What’s changed is the range of people coming to make deals in politics, health care, virtual currencies, socially responsible investments and cannabis.Those speaking at the conference included House Speaker Paul Ryan and former Majority Leader Eric Cantor, as well as Tennessee Republican Senator Bob Corker and former Democratic U.S. Representative Harold Ford, also of Tennessee.

        One Milken attendee said he had heard of 14 Republican fundraisers scheduled around the four-day conference. Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who was a featured Milken speaker, also attended the Malibu event.Democrats didn’t pass up the chance to tap donors either.
