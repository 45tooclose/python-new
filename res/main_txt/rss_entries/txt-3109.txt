  The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) announced that it would start replacing its Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS) with its new blockchain-powered platform developed by Digital Asset over the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. The securities exchange operator published a consultation paper on the CHESS replacement, which describes the key aspects of the shift. At the beginning of 2019, the first customer trials should start, with migration testing scheduled for June 2020.
However, the timing may suffer changes after the current consultation process and throughout the lifecycle of the new system implementation as the platform is further developed. ASX said it would come with another update in late July of this year.
Here is the full plan with the indicative dates that represent the best case scenarios:

In December 2017, we reported that the ASX officially announced the adoption of blockchain technology for registering shareholder stakes and dealing with clearing and settlement procedures. It was a big victory for the emerging technology at that time. The decision was made after the ASX had run pilots on blockchain for about two years.
The ASX stated in their consultation paper that about 50 new features would be ready for use with the new blockchain-based platform, which will cover areas such as pre-settlement, settlement, account structures and information, and corporate action processes.

Australian companies and market participants will be able to connect as they do today. However, they’ll also have the option to use the global ISO 20022 message scheme or may get in touch via a node on the distributed ledger.
According to the paper:

“ASX will replace CHESS with a post-trade solution that provides users with more efficient clearing, settlement and other post-trade services through improved record keeping, reduced reconciliation, more timely transactions, and better quality data. The new system incorporates a permissioned distributed ledger that will provide benefits for users.”
