Kraken Ceo Will Not Comply with ‘Insulting’ New York Crypto Probe Firms operating outside New York are not liable to answer notices issued by New York’s Attorney General.

Though most of the exchanges welcomed the move, a few operating outside the state of New York did not like the interference of a state authority outside its jurisdiction.New York AG’s office explains that the order was “requesting disclosures on their operations, use of bots, conflicts of interest, outages, and other key issues”. It further mentioned that the order was released with an aim of “protecting consumers”.Responding to the order, Kraken’s CEO Jesse Powell clearly refused to respond to Schneiderman’s request, stressing that the exchange will not provide any information about its business.He noted: ”When I saw this 34-point demand, with a deadline 2 weeks out, I immediately thought ‘The audacity of these guys — the entitlement, the disrespect for our business, our time!’”Somebody has to say what everybody's actually thinking about the NYAG's inquiry. The placative kowtowing toward this kind of abuse sends the message that it's ok. It's not ok. It's insulting. https://t.co/sta9VuXPK1 pic.twitter.com/4Jg66bia1I— Jesse Powell (@jespow) April 18, 2018BitLicense’s regimeSince 2015, multiple crypto businesses, including Kraken, moved their bases away from New York after facing the state’s harsh cryptocurrency framework – BitLicense. Kraken, at that time, called it “a creature so foul, so cruel that not even Kraken possesses the courage or strength to face its nasty, big, pointy teeth”.Powell, in his statement, is now praising the firm’s wise decision to move out of New York.“Kraken left New York because New York is hostile to crypto, and this ‘questionnaire’ we received today proves that New York is not only hostile to crypto, it is hostile to business,” he added.Community supportMoreover, for refusing New York AG’s recent order, Jesse Powell has received support from many figures of the nascent industry, including the CEO of ShapeShift, Erik Voorhees.Jesse – thank you for taking the ethical stance and speaking up for what's right. Crypto has brought more transparency to finance and protection to consumers than the last 100 years of bureaucratic nonsense that has spilled from the sewers of New York. https://t.co/CsGaEO8R4F— Erik Voorhees (@ErikVoorhees) April 19, 2018AG’s responseResponding to Kraken’s refusal, a spokesperson for the Attorney General’s office told CoinDesk: “Legitimate entities generally like to demonstrate to their investors that their money will be protected. This is basic information that credible platforms should all have on hand.” googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: blockchain / cryptocurrency / Kraken / new york attorney / united-statesRelated News Interoperability Proven: BTC Lightning Network Closer to Release than Ever  Telegram Founder Pavel Durov: Privacy is Not for Sale  4th-Gen Blockchain-Based BibleCoin Set to Launch Amid Deal with GNN  Got a news tip?
