      Biothermal energy is a type of renewable energy derived from the composting of organic material. It often uses waste byproducts of agriculture, such as the fibrous matter that remains from sugarcane after the sucrose has been extracted. It is considered a viable alternative form of energy but is still in its early stages of development.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Biothermal Energy'
      Biothermal energy was first developed and popularized by the French inventor and  farmer Jean Pain in the 1970s. Pain created 10-foot-high mounds of compost from macerated underbrush that generated enough heat and methane gas to supply all his household hot water and electricity needs, plus run a small van.
Biothermal Energy: Rot Makes Hot
The process came to be known as Jean Pain Composting, and it relied on the principle that rot makes hot. In other words, micro-organisms which assist in the breaking down of organic material through anaerobic digestion create heat, methane, carbon dioxide and other gases. These byproducts can be used in a variety of applications.
By running hundreds of feet of water tubing through his compost piles, Pain was able to heat his household water to 140 degrees. Moreover, he collected the off-gasses from his compost pile into discarded truck tire inner tubes and developed ways to inexpensively clean and compress the gas into usable methane. A methane-fueled combustion engine generated electricity, and the gas also powered his cookstove and van. He estimated that 88 pounds of brush wood provided the equivalent energy of a gallon of gasoline.
Large-Scale Applications
Pain’s experiments seemed quixotic to some (with efficiencies that have proven difficult to reproduce), but biothermal energy has gained significant followers, and advances continue. In particular the field of methane and ethanol gas production from compost matter has been both lucrative and environmentally beneficial. This is especially true when useful energy is derived from animal waste. Some sewage plants are even harvesting methane gas from human waste.
Because biothermal energy requires large areas for composting it has mainly been applied in agricultural environments. For example, many farms are now using the energy generated from compost piles to heat greenhouses. Further innovations may make it possible to use biothermal energy as a large-scale supplement for home heating or to capture methane and other biogases for use in place of natural gas. One promising technology converts the chemical energy stored in wastewater directly into electricity, but so far it is not economically viable. Meanwhile, some companies are experimenting with creating so-called biopolymers from organic waste, which is essentially plastic made from compost.
