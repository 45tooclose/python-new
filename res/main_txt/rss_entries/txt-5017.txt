            President Donald Trump hinted he won’t sit for an interview with Robert Mueller, telling reporters that he’d “love” to meet with the special counsel but that he has to listen to his lawyers.He complained about Mueller’s investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election as he boarded the presidential helicopter on Friday, saying: “If you fight back, they say ’oh, that’s obstruction,”’ he told reporters.Trump’s new lead attorney, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, has said that any interview with Mueller would be constrained, if it happens at all.

        “If we came to conclusion they have already made up their mind and Comey is telling the truth -- that is a joke, Comey hasn’t told the truth in years -- then we would just be leading him into the lion’s den,” Giuliani said in an interview on Wednesday, referring to former FBI Director James Comey.“I have to find that we’re going to be treated fairly,” Trump said Friday.
