The CEO of crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital, forecast that the crypto market could hit “$40 trln" within ten years, in a Bloomberg interview earlier this week. Tech giant IBM broke news twice with Blockchain-focused initiatives, signalling that major tech industry players are edging closer towards realizing real world Blockchain applications.Yet others from the traditional financial sector continue to balk at short time volatility, with American investor, Warren Buffett, again scorning investment in cryptocurrencies in an interview yesterday, April 28. The 87-year old investor joined ranks with other Bitcoin sceptics, such as the ousted Paypal CEO, Bill Harris, who this week said that “Bitcoin is a scam,” and that crypto traders are “drinking the Kool-Aid”, in an apparent reference to the poison-laced drink which killed over 900 cult members in the Jonestown Massacre of 1978.
