            Attorney General Jeff Sessions refused Wednesday to say whether he’s recused himself from involvement in the Justice Department’s investigation into President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.“I should not answer that question; it would be inappropriate to do so,” Sessions said at a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing. “It is the policy of the department that if you get into discussing the details of those matters you can reveal the existence, scope, breadth or nature of the matter.”A person familiar with the matter said earlier that Sessions has decided not to recuse himself from the Justice Department’s Cohen investigation but will step back from specific matters if required by department rules.

        Leahy said the Justice Department is “under siege,” with Trump’s “relentless, and I think baseless attacks” on senior leaders of the department and the FBI.
