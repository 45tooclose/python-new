      Conduct costs are any payments made by a bank in the settlement of regulatory decisions, litigation or fines. Conduct costs include sums set aside to cover these expenses as well as opportunity costs directly attributed to actions taken under the legal or regulatory decision. Roger McCormick, Visiting Professor at the London School of Economics, brought these costs to the forefront by creating the Conduct Cost Project, a research initiative aimed at synthesizing conduct costs at the world’s largest banks from public data and making the analysis public. The CCP Research Foundation continues the work of the Conduct Cost Project.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Conduct Costs'
      Conduct costs are the price banks pay when they engage in unethical behavior as outlined by the law and the regulatory framework in the countries in which they operate. Conduct costs for the largest banks in the world routinely exceed hundreds of billions of dollars. More importantly, conduct costs have implications beyond the banks that pay them. The capital spent by banks on conduct costs filters through the business and affects the loans, the savings, the returns and all other forms of economic activity that a bank touches.
Conduct costs tend to lag the actual behavior that incurs them. This is because legal cases can take years to settle in the courts. In publicizing conduct costs, the hope is that it will encourage banks to review their internal compliance and remove conflicting incentives that encourage non-compliance. For example, bonuses for signing up people for mortgages regardless of creditworthiness – a practice that was widespread leading up to the subprime mortgage meltdown.
Factors That Influence Conduct Cost
The size and differing business models of banks have an influence on their levels of conduct costs. The larger a bank is and the more regulatory areas it straddles with its business operations, the greater the chance that conduct costs will be incurred. Also, if a bank is heavily involved in investment and the creation of financial assets, the opportunity for ethical lapses increases because performance incentives may convince employees and management that it is worth risking the chance of getting caught in the longer-term for the certainty of cash in the short-term.
The location of a bank’s business operations also influences the conduct costs. Banks in poorly regulated regions of the world may have lower conduct costs regardless of their conduct. Similarly, state-owned banks may not even be held to a regulatory standard like a private bank.
