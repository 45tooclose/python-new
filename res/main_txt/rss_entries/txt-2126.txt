It provides a data-driven decentralized mobile game advertising platform and connects gaming companies and gamers in a direct and cost-efficient manner using blockchain, without the need for any intermediaries.Mentioning PLACTAL’s platform, Coinsilium Group’s CEO Eddy Travia commented: “We are seeing a growing need for greater transparency in advertising models on digital platforms, and this is an issue that PLACTAL is specifically addressing within the mobile gaming industry. Mobile advertising has historically proven to be a tougher market than online advertising and PLACTAL’s use of data aims to remove the current inefficiencies and friction within this market.”The gaming sector is one of the most conducive sectors for blockchain technology and cryptocurrency adaptation. PLACTAL is targeting this rich industry with its blockchain-based advertising model. Through the use of decentralized technology, PLACTAL preserves a gamer’s experience by tokenizing their gameplay data and creating a resume for them on the blockchain.“The PLACTAL team has a wealth of experience in smartphone applications and mobile content which they intend to carry across to this exciting project. There is a strong gaming community in South Korea and Asia in general which, combined with a widespread awareness and usage of digital currencies, should contribute towards a natural network effect to drive the rapid adoption of the PLACTAL platform,” Travia added.Earlier this month, Consilium Group gained another client – TrustedHealth – to provide similar advisory services.Moreover, the business of Coinsilium gained momentum after it raised over £720,000 ($960,800) late last year by selling 8.0 million ordinary shares of company stock. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: blockchain / Coinsilium / cryptocurrency / london / singaporeRelated News NEO Blockchain’s First Decentralized Exchange Goes Live  German ICO Savedroid Pulls Exit Scam After Raising $50 Million  Trading Energy on a Blockchain: Power Ledger Begins Testing in Japan  Got a news tip?
