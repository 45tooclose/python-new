        Priebus is a former chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party and lived in the state before becoming chairman of the Republican National Committee in 2011.“Reince Priebus says ’candidates matter’ in close elections, and it is of paramount importance that the republicans sift and winnow the poor candidates out early, to put up quality individuals,” Weber tweeted.
