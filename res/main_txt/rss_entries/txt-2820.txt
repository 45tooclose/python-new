(NASDAQ: AMZN) is one of the biggest retail and technology companies in the country with a market capitalization that exceeds $667 billion. Last year, the company also announced plans for a second headquarters in the United States, which it said will create 50,000 jobs and billions of dollars in construction investments in the new location. Recently, the company's stock has come under pressure after criticism from U.S. President Donald trump.
The company was founded in July 1994 by Jeffrey Bezos, initially only as an online bookstore. As the company evolved, it began selling DVDs, CDs, and streaming music and video services. It then began offering a wide variety of products such as cloud storage, video games, software and electronics, clothing, toys and food. In fact, there are few things you can't get on Amazon. According to the company's 2017 financials, it employed approximately 566,000 people, had operating cash flow of $18.4 billion and had revenue of $177.9 billion.
