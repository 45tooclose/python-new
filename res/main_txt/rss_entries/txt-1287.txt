        The U.S., U.K. and France accuse President Bashar Al-Assad of carrying out the April 7 attack, which killed dozens of people. The allies struck Syrian military targets over the weekend in retaliation. Both Syria and its main backer, Russia, deny the Syrian government used chemical weapons.The U.S. said it was considering imposing new sanctions on Russia and a decision would be taken in the near future. But a Washington Post report said President Donald Trump abandoned that idea following the missile strike, and was unlikely to approve additional penalties without a new provocation.
