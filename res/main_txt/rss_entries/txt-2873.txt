      BREAKING DOWN 'Net Debt to Assessed Valuation'
      Net debt to asset valuation is one of the factors used to determine the credit quality of a municipal bond issue. There are many types of municipal bonds, but the broadest categories are general obligation (GO) bonds and revenue bonds. GO bonds are backed by the credit of the issuing state or local government and their ability to tax. Revenue bonds usually are issued to fund specific projects and are repaid by special taxes or by the revenue generated by the project. The lower a municipality's debt is relative to the assessed value of its property, the less risky its bonds are deemed to be, as there is less risk of the government being unable to finance repayment of the bond issue. A higher ratio could indicate that a sale of the underlying assets might be insufficient to pay the debt.
The net debt to assessed valuation formula is (short-term debt + long-term debt - cash and cash equivalents)/total estimated market value of property or assets. For example, a municipal issuer has $200 million in short-term debt, $200 million in long-term debt and $20 million in cash and cash equivalents. The market value of the municipality’s real property, public utilities, and personal property is $500 million. According to the formula, net debt to estimated valuation is: ($200 mn + $200 mn - $20 mn)/$500 mn = 0.76.
Debt ratios in municipal bond financing
Debt ratios are comparative statistics showing the relationship between the issuer’s outstanding debt and factors such as its tax base, income or population. These ratios are used primarily for GO bonds or other tax-supported debt. Some of the more commonly used ratios in addition to net overall debt to asset valuation are: net overall debt to estimated full valuation; net overall debt per capita; and tax-supported debt to personal income. For example, net overall debt per capita is the amount of an issuer’s debt outstanding divided by the population residing within the issuer’s jurisdiction. It provides an indication of the issuer’s credit position because compares the proportion of debt borne per resident there with that of residents in other jurisdictions. And tax supported debt to personal income, for example, would be comparing a state’s level of debt to the total personal income of its residents, which measures the state’s ability to repay its obligations because it indicates its ability to generate revenue.
