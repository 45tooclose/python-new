      A lottery bond is a type of government bond, most famously issued by the United Kingdom's National Savings and Investment, or NS&I, which gives the holder a chance to win a random monthly drawing for a tax-free cash prize. The bonds don't pay interest but they do encourage saving. However, because they don't pay interest, they are not protected against inflation.
Otherwise, these are considered extremely safe because they are backed by the U.K. government. The bonds can be purchased directly from NS&I or from the post office. Each bond is worth £1 and there is a £100 minimum investment.
A lottery bond also refers to a type of commercial surety bond that establishments with lottery machines must purchase to prevent abuse of the state lottery system.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Lottery Bond'
      Officially called Premium Bonds, the U.K.'s lottery bonds were introduced in 1956 with the goal of reducing inflation and attracting people who were otherwise not interested in saving. In 2008, £40 billion was invested in Premium Bonds, one of the country's most popular savings vehicles. A machine called ERNIE randomly generates the winning bond numbers. The amount of the prize fund is a month's interest on all eligible bonds, and multiple winners are paid prizes of varying amounts from that fund.
Other examples of Lottery Bonds
Lottery bonds were widely used during the nineteenth century. They were issued by states and municipalities or issued by companies like the Panama Canal Company and the Suez Canal Company with state backing.
Lottery bonds have been adopted in countries outside the U.K., after the British government had success using them as a means to promote savings. New Zealand issued its lottery bond, called Bonus Bonds, in 1970.
When New Zealanders buy bonus bonds, their money is pooled with other bond holders and invested in fixed interest assets and cash equivalents. The interest earned on these investments are used to fund the prizes that are awarded, and to maintain the principal investment value of the non-winners bonus bonds. In 2017, the average monthly prize was $4,109. There were an average of 134,942 winners each month out of 3,373,920,421 eligible bonus bond holders.
Swedish lottery bonds were used for many years as a means of tax arbitrage by wealthy investors. An investor with a capital gain from the stock market purchases lottery bonds before the lottery is drawn, sells those bonds at a lost after the lottery is over,  and covers the loss with the tax-free proceeds from the bond lottery. Though popular in the 1970s and 1980s, the strategy was ended when Sweden reformed its tax laws in 1991.
