His main challenger, Milan Bojanic, got 33 percent, according to results from the state election commission, based on 97 percent of votes counted on Monday.

He will replace his ally, Filip Vujanovic, who used up the legal limit of two consecutive five-year terms.

        Djukanovic, 56, rose through the ranks of Yugoslavia’s single-party Communist system to become Montenegro’s prime minister first in 1991 when he was allied with Serb strongman Slobodan Milosevic. He later distanced himself from the late autocrat and oversaw a 2006 split from Serbia and accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 2017.He stepped down as premier in 2016 after accusing Russia of trying to assassinate him during a coup attempt. With his comeback victory, he defeated Bojanic, who was nominated by opposition parties that include pro-Russian, anti-NATO groups.
