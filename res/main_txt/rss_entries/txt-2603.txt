      A utility revenue bond is a debt security which is designed to finance a public utility project. The utility is required to repay bondholders directly from project revenues rather than a general tax fund.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Utility Revenue Bond'
      A utility revenue bond, also known as an essential service bond, is an interest-bearing or discounted debt security which a utility or municipality issues in order to finance a capital project. The projects tend to be in areas considered essential to public services including hospitals, water, waste treatment or electricity. These services generate revenue through customer fees which provide cash flows that can cover debt service obligations.
Revenue bonds can have one of two debt service structures: a gross revenue pledge or a net revenue pledge.  Under the gross approach, bondholder payments are prioritized over any operational or maintenance costs incurred by the project. The net revenue pledge allows for the payment of such costs prior to satisfying obligations to bondholders. Since utilities generally deliver services considered essential to their customers - water, electricity - it is common for utility revenue bonds to feature the net revenue pledge. It is also common for utilities to be required to maintain a certain revenue-to-expenditure ratio. Debt repayment is included in this calculation as an expense, and the ratio is often used to support customer rate increases for public utilities.
Utility Revenue Bonds vs General Obligation Bonds
Any municipal bond carries the promise to repay bondholders through one of two cash flows: municipal taxation or the revenues associated with a particular public project. Utility revenue bonds fall under the latter debt structure, while the former is known as a general obligation bond (GO). The issuer of a GO bond, often a state, city or town, guarantees the repayment of that debt via any means necessary. It can raise taxes, issue another round of bonds or even sell physical assets to raise the needed money. The issuer of the debt is not constrained to a single stream of revenue to satisfy its obligation. Investors should be aware of this distinction, and can put it to use in assembling a diversified fixed-income portfolio.
Other factors come into play when credit ratings agencies or investors evaluate utility revenue bonds and the projects which they finance. Coverage is the ratio of expected revenues to principal and interest obligations. Population size and trends can provide an idea of future revenue growth or decline for a utility project. Customer concentration describes the mix of consumers whose usage fees support debt repayment. If a small number of consumers use a large portion of a public utility’s service, that may lead to risk for the viability of that project’s revenues.
