Introducing the first major UK-based asset management firm onto our ELAC Platform is a remarkable achievement for ACI FMA and shows the work ACI is doing to assist the wider industry in embracing the Code. We look forward to working closely with Millennium Global to improve market standards, education, training and ethical conduct.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: FX Global Code of ConductRelated News Intercontinental Exchange Reports Weak Metrics for March, FX Volumes ‎Advance MoM  SEC Awards $2.2m to Whistleblower Despite Reporting Tip to Other Agency  Portware Commits to FX Global Code of Conduct as Adoption Continues  Got a news tip?
