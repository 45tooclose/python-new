According to its official website, last year it featured 6,500 exhibitors, attracted 225,000 attendees from more than 70 countries, and facilitated 5.6 million business contracts.The 2018 Messe will be opened by Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany, and Enrique Peña Nieto, President of Mexico.The founders of IOTA said that a number of companies will be presenting use cases, including Bosch, DXC, Deutsche Telekom, Accessec GmbH, and Fujitsu.#Fujitsu #K5 #IOTA permanent node in action.

This was the result of the company’s announcement that it was partnering with more than 20 companies to create a new data marketplace. One of those partners was apparently Microsoft, although it later emerged that their relationship was not as official as it was originally made out to be.In the few weeks leading up to the Hannover Messe, its value has approximately doubled.https://t.co/cqET7Ll46O“IOTA seems to be among the most interesting innovations with the greatest potential for change, at our Fujitsu booth at the Hannover Messe Industrie, we will also be showing a live demo of the IOTA technology.” -Walter Graf Fujitsu Distinguished Engineer— IOTA (@iotatoken) March 20, 2018 The IOTA blockchain is one of the many that are designed to be quicker and lighter than that of Bitcoin. It approves transactions instantly and with no fees by allowing transactions to be added to the chain in a non-linear fashion, delegating the mining process to small groups of nodes and by allowing transactions to take place off the chain. In this it is not particularly unique – the particular selling point of IOT is that it is designed to be integrated into the internet of things, a concept in which everyday services and household devices are controlled by the internet. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: conference / cryptocurrency / fujitsu / germany / hannover / industry / IoT / IOTARelated News Interoperability Proven: BTC Lightning Network Closer to Release than Ever  German ICO Savedroid Pulls Exit Scam After Raising $50 Million  Biggest Investment Firm in Brazil to Launch Cryptocurrency Exchange  Got a news tip?
