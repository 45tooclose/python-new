Unlike fixed-supply cryptocurrencies, ‎the Basis protocol is designed to expand and contract supply similarly to the way central ‎banks use to intervene in forex markets to stabilize its national currency. ‎The cryptocurrency aims to keep its price stable by algorithmically adjusting supply. ‎The platform will issue more tokens when demand is rising and will buy back the coin ‎when the supply increases to restore Basis price.‎‎“If you have a Basecoin, it’ll be worth $1 today; it’ll be worth $1 ‎tomorrow; it’ll be worth $1 forever,” Intangible Labs CEO and co-‎founder Nader Al-Naji said.‎‎”Volatility of cryptocurrencies has prevented their widespread ‎adoption. We are trying to build cryptocurrencies that ‎have all the benefits of crypto but is stable,”‎ he told Reuters in an interview last year.Intangible Labs was created by three Princeton University computer science graduates. ‎Aside from Al-Naji, the other founders of Intangible Labs are former ‎Princeton classmates Lawrence Diao and Josh Chen.‎ googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: Crypto news / ICOsRelated News Cloud Mining Put to the Test- Is It Worth Your Money?
