We believe that it is reshaping the crypto industry. Moreover, with Changelly’s API and widget integrated from the very product launch, I believe that this project will have a huge impact on the ecosystem.How it WorksFor those interested in exactly how the integration between NAGA and Changelly will work; it really is quite simple.Changelly’s integrated API essentially acts as a bridge between the NAGA Wallet and popular trading platforms like Binance, Bittrex, and others. The integration is evident in the wallet’s efficient interface, thus allowing users to seamlessly swap tokens and coins with only a few clicks — without ever having to leave the NAGA Wallet.Better yet, the API automatically picks up the best exchange rate from all of the supported trading platforms and offers that suggestion to the user — so users can rest assured that they’re getting the most advantageous rate.As an additional bonus, Changelly listed NAGA Coin, making the NAGA ecosystem’s underlying coin available to exchange on Changelly’s website.This is undoubtedly great news for both NAGA and Changelly, as the seamless integration will make trading cryptocurrencies easier and more efficient than ever.What do you think about Changelly’s integration into the NAGA Wallet?
