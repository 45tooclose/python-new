        Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told reporters in Taipei that China lured the Dominican Republic with money and the island would not bow to pressure from Beijing. He added that relations with other allies were stable and there’s no immediate danger to Taiwan’s ties with the Vatican.Dominican Republic President Danilo Medina’s legal aide Flavio Dario Espinal said the establishment of ties with China creates "immense" opportunities in areas from finance to technology, tourism, education and energy. The Communist Party considers Taiwan a province and has criticized Tsai’s refusal to accept that both sides belong to “One China,” its precondition for ties. Since her pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party was swept to power in 2016, Beijing has attempted to woo Taiwan’s remaining diplomatic partners. In June last year, it won over Panama.— With assistance by Jim Jia
