        Their release is the biggest setback yet for prosecutors investigating the so-called Carwash case, which has implicated former Peruvian presidents, ministers and company executives. An appeal court this month revoked the pre-trial detention of Jose Grana, the former chairman of Grana y Montero SAA, Peru’s biggest builder, after four months in jail.The head of the national magistrates council, Orlando Velasquez, earlier this year called for a reevaluation of the use of preventive detention orders, which he said violate constitutional rights.Prosecutors are also seeking the extradition of former President Alejandro Toledo from the U.S. to face trial for alleged graft. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski quit as president of Peru last month after becoming ensnared in Carwash and has been barred from leaving the country.
