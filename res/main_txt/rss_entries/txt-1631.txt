The latest addition expands the Commission’s existing offering which currently includes 7 languages: English, Russian, Chinese, Spanish, Turkish, Thai and Indonesian.The release of the Arabic service comes shortly after the Financial Commission substantially ‎increased the maximum amount assured under its Compensation Fund.‎The decision will benefit clients of the ‎Commission’s contributing members, which include international online ‎brokerages ‎that participate in global foreign exchange ‎‎(forex), derivatives and ‎cryptocurrency markets.‎Specifically, the Compensation Fund increased its maximum ‎coverage amount ‎to 20,000 euro ($24,500) per client of an A-Category Member. For ‎the claims sought by clients of a B-Category Member‎, the maximum amount ‎recoverable by a claimant was hiked to 5,000 euro ($6,119). This ‎represents an increase of over 20 percent in US dollar terms.‎Chairman of the Board, Peter Tatarnikov commented on the news: “We have been exploring the opportunities in the Middle Eastern region for some time now because we see a growing Forex market with brokers launching local operations in country. We also continue to experience a growing interest from Arabic-speaking traders who seek our help in resolving questions they have about trading, investing and their current broker of choice. So today we have taken an important step forward and will provide traders in the region the same dedicated support that we provide as an organization in other regions.” googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: Arabic / financial commission / Middle EastRelated News FX Arrests in Poland, Lawsuit Seeks Hard Fork of Nano: Best of the Week  Breaking: Equiti Group Acquires First Forex Broker License in Kenya  Q8Trade Sponsors Kuwait Soccer Team Al-Qadsia  Got a news tip?
