CoinMarketCap, the popular cryptocurrency market data site, has released its first mobile app.
The Tuesday release - which is currently only available for iOS users - comes as the site marks its fifth anniversary since launching in 2013. CoinMarketCap lists prices for hundreds of coins and tokens as well as trading volume data for exchanges. The site has become one of the most-visited in the world, ranking 174th in Alexa's global rankings.
According to a post by the company published alongside the app's release, CoinmarketCap has received 60 million unique visits tus far in 2018.
"The space has really evolved in the past five years and so have we," CEO Brandon Chez said in a statement. "So we thought for this anniversary, it would be nice to do something big for our users." 

CoinMarketCap's app is available from the iTunes Store free of charge and includes ads. It has earned 12 ratings at the time of writing, all of them five stars. The company also unveiled a new logo Tuesday.
Amidst growing interest in digital assets, ConiMarketCap faces increasing competition. Thomson Reuters, an established data provider, has added bitcoin, ether, litecoin, bitcoin cash and Ripple's XRP to its data offerings. The company is also offering indices based on data from CryptoCompare, CoinMarketCap's less-trafficked rival.
