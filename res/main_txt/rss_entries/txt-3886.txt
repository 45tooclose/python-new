      Term federal funds are balances purchased in Federal Reserve accounts for a period of more than a single day. Term federal funds usually have a maximum term of 90 days. Banks may need to obtain these funds when their borrowing needs will last for several days. This means they cannot make do with simply borrowing overnight funds, as is the common practice among financial institutions.
These loans are unsecured and can be extended at a low interest rate, which is known as the federal funds rate, or sometimes also referred to as the overnight rate. This overnight rate is usually the lowest rate available, and is offered to only the most reliable, credit-worthy borrowers. Banks and related institutions are generally considered very secure and worthy of this coveted interest rate.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Term Federal Funds'
      Term federal funds are obtained via transactions that take place between two banks or other financial institutions. With term federal funds, a contract spells out the specifics of the transaction as far as the term until the funds are repaid, which is basically the time of maturity, and also the fixed interest rate that will apply. The contract may also stipulate whether the lender can call in the loan before it reaches maturity or if the borrowing bank can repay the funds early.
The appeal of term federal funds
There are several reasons why many financial institutions find term federal funds to be such a convenient and appealing tactic for efficient business operations. For a bank or lending institution, the process of obtaining term federal funds is fairly simple. This tactic is also financially appealing because of the minimal interest charges that would be incurred. For these transactions, the federal funds rate would apply. This is the interest rate which banks and other depository institutions charge when lending each other money, usually just for overnight, from their Federal Reserve funds. This process of transferring funds for term federal funds is somewhat similar to the process involved in exchanging overnight funds in what is known as the overnight market.Â 
Banks also purchase term federal funds in order to lock in the current short-term interest rate in a rising rate environment. These funds resemble overnight federal funds in that they are not subject to reserve requirements, meaning the amount of funds they are required to keep on hand at a given time. For this reason, they are often purchased in lieu of other comparable instruments with similar maturities.
