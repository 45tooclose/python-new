Let’s look at DocuSign's various offerings, and how it uses them to make money.
DocuSign’s e-Signature Solutions and Services
DocuSign does not charge individuals who sign the documents, but it makes money from the counterparties who initiate the contracts.
For instance, if an Africa-based content writer is hired by a U.S.-based web portal and a contract needs to be signed between the two, the writer will not be charged for signing the DocuSign contract sent to him/her electronically by the web portal employer. Only the employer will need to pay DocuSign for creating, hosting, notifying, and managing such contracts and signatures.
DocuSign offers annual as well as monthly plans in many variants to cater to the needs of a variety of users and businesses. 
The Personal plan allows a single user to send up to five documents each month to collect signatures and is suitable for individual contractors and small-scale employers. It offers basic features, like specified number of fields to collect basic information, reusable templates, basic workflows that automatically move the documents from one party to the other based on submission status, support for multiple languages, and integration with various online storage solutions like Google Drive and DropBox. The plan starts at $120 annually.
The Standard plan additionally offers functionality to set and send automated reminders, and personal branding across a range of documents. Standard plan starts at $300 annually per user.
The Business Pro plan offers additional features which are intended for large organizations. They include two-factor text message authentication, in-person signatures on client devices, bulk sending of forms and documents, and even the collection of any necessary payments like those for submitting a form fee or paying for an invoice. Annual charges for Business Pro plan start at $480 per user.
Additionally, DocuSign also offers bespoke custom solutions.

Other Products and Solutions
Though DocuSign is mostly popular for its e-signature services, it also makes money from a host of other products and services.
DocuSign Payments allows for the collection of payments and signatures in one step, thereby reducing cost overhead.
