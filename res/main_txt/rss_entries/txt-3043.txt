      BREAKING DOWN 'Mist Browser'
      The content, features and functionality available on the Ethereum network can be accessed and utilized through two resources - a Mist wallet and a Mist browser. First is the common, standard cryptocurrency wallet that is used to store, send and receive cryptocurrency funds, though it is different from the Ethereum wallet. Mist wallet runs on a user’s computer, which means it has to be downloaded, installed and run it on the computer. In contrast, the Ethereum wallet is an online wallet, and users need internet access to log-in to the wallet.
The Mist browser is an Ethereum interface, which allows users to access the various dApps available on the Ethereum network. It is also known as the Ethereum dApp Browser.
Understanding Mist Browser
A standard web browser like Chrome, Firefox or Internet Explorer allows users to access websites such as Yahoo, Facebook and Google. A similar comparison can be made to various mobile apps available through Google Play. Similarly, Mist browser also allows users to access decentralized apps available on the Ethereum network.
However, the word “browser” doesn't fully capture the Mist browser's capabilities. It doesn't only display existing apps, it is a workbench, a collection of decentralized blockchain tools for the Ethereum network. It is a tool specifically designed for non-technical users who can build, copy, utilize, configure and run any existing or new decentralized apps right from the browser.
Some tasks that can be performed through the Mist browser include:
Generating user selected smart contracts that aim to make business transactions safer and more reliable. By using the on-screen configuration screens, even non-technical users can easily create and run various contracts and dApps through Mist browser
Enabling people to pool their money, like in a trustless, decentralized crowdfunding solution, which allows a variety of people to contribute, invest and benefit from new and promising business propositions
Sharing important information in a reliable manner, which can be contributed by a select group of participants. For instance, a majority of individuals check weather updates on daily basis, but such key information needs to be contributed only by designated and qualified individuals. Mist browser allows a user to create such a configuration through which a database can be created to allow a public view.
Essentially, the Mist browser allows people to “do” things right from the browser by offering them readymade templates, allows them to build configurations and customizations, and to perform necessary actions, rather than just act as an app or a website.
