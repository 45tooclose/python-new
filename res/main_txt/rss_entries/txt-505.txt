Ledger wallet users have been unable to access their bitcoin cash since Monday, and some users believe the hardware manufacturer is dragging its feet.
According to complaints lodged by users on Reddit, they are unable to access their bitcoin cash wallets, cannot view their balances or make transactions. The outage is halfway through its second day, according to a user who posted about the issue shortly before midnight Tuesday.
One user wrote:
"After ~20 hours, this issue is still not resolved. I can't access my BCH wallet at all (no transactions show up, despite being visible on an explorer...This seems like a pretty major outage considering the coins don't even show up, much less being able to spend them." 

An incident status post, which first acknowledged the problem on Monday at 6:30 p.m. UTC, reads, "The new version of Bitcoin-ABC (bitcoin cash node) breaks compatibility with our parser. As a result balances shown on the Ledger Wallet are incorrect. Our engineering team is currently working on a fix."
Subsequent updates outlined the team's efforts to bring the wallet back up. The latest one as of press time, published at 6:56 p.m. UTC Tuesday, said "the blockchain explorer has been restarted successfully, and is now cleaning every transaction" that happened since a recent block.
However, the update also estimates that it will take at least an hour before the startup can begin syncing.
Ledger CEO Eric Larcheveque told Reddit users that the company is reindexing its bitcoin cash nodes, and advised users to utilize the Electron Cash wallet to access their funds in the interim.
However, users complained that the Electron Cash wallet is also not working properly.
Likewise, a comment attributed to Ledger CTO Nicolas Bacca which said that he is "not following [the issue] closely," triggered criticism from users.
"It's disappointing to see such an issue taking so long to resolve, I would've hoped for more professionalism from Ledger, but it seems like they treat bitcoin cash as a minority token with a very low priority," one person wrote.
