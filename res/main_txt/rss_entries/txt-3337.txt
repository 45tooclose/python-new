      An itemized statement is a periodic document issued by a financial institution, such as a bank or brokerage firm, to its customers detailing all account activity for the period. Itemized statements include deposits, credits, debts, fees and all other pertinent activity. Usually, this information is presented in chronological order, although it may be broken down in several different ways for the customer's convenience.
