The CEO of Nasdaq suggested Wednesday that the company could open a cryptocurrency exchange in the future.
The subject came up during an interview with CNBC, during which CEO Adena Friedman expressed openness to the idea.
"Certainly Nasdaq would consider becoming a crypto exchange over time," Friedman remarked, adding:
"If we do look at it and say 'it's time, people are ready for a more regulated market,' for something that providesÂ a fair experience for investors... I believe that digital currencies will continue to persist it's just a matter of how long it will take for that space to mature. Once you look at it and say, 'do we want to provide a regulated market for this?' Certainly Nasdaq would consider it." 

While Nasdaq is unlikely to launch such a service anytime soon, the company is no stranger to the tech itself. In addition to playing home to several blockchain-focused ETFs as well as public companies that are focused on the technology, Nasdaq has a long-standing relationship with blockchain startup Chain.
And as previously reported, the company has worked on technology applications, as demonstrated through patent filings. For example, the company was awarded a patent in October for a data-matching system that employs blockchain as a means to track trades and clearing positions.
