In December 2015, Overstock filed with the SEC an S-3 registration statement to register a preferred stock digital security utilizing tZERO’s blockchain technology, which was subsequently declared effective in December 2016.”“Overstock used that S-3 to issue what we believe was the world’s first public blockchain security, OSTKP, utilizing tZERO technology once again. Now we are unveiling tZERO’s security token trading software: the astute viewer of our progress can look at this, and the collection of strategic assets we have assembled, and get an idea of the breadth of what we intend,” he added.According to its president Joe Cammarat, the firm is delaying the launch of the final version of the platform due to regulatory compliances. However, tZero’s team is very optimistic about the new platform and its prototype.“Technologically speaking, we anticipate the security token trading software will be ready to trade security tokens in May, subject to developing further regulatory clarity,” said Cammarata. “We have been working hard on getting this prototype right and look forward to user feedback.”Earlier this year, tZero was chosen to provide advisory services to WENN Digital to ease the token offering of KODAKCoin. In addition, its role includes encryption of accounts, price quoting, clearing and reconciliation services, anti-money laundering services and know-your-customer verification. KODAKCoin, whose offering began in late January, was the first third-party security token on the tZERO platform.“We’re making history and we thank everyone involved in creating this new digital ledger platform. We also want to thank our customers; we’re doing this together,” Cammarata added. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: blockchain / Overstock / trading platformRelated News First Soros Invests in Cryptocurrency and Now Rockefeller – Is Buffett Next?
