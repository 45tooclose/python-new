The stock is an important component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Intel stock has a P/E ratio of 22.74, while the three major averages have P/E ratios of 23.63, 24.09 and 25.01, respectively. Intel is also the heaviest weighed component of the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX), with a 9.3% weight among the 30 components of the ETF.
Intel stock closed Thursday at $52.28, up 13.3% year to date and up 24.4% since its 2018 low of $42.04 set on Feb. 9. The stock set its 2018 high of $55.79 on April 27, the morning after the earnings beat reported after the close on April 26.
The PHLX Semiconductor Index is up just 1.1% year to date and is just 5.3% above its Feb. 9 low. The index is in correction territory at 13.5% below its high set on March 13. Intel reported robust first quarter earnings on April 26 and raised its full-year 2018 revenue guidance.

The daily chart for Intel

The daily chart shows that Intel has been above a "golden cross" since Oct. 2, when the stock closed at $39.04. A "golden cross" occurs when the 50-day simple moving average rises above the 200-day simple moving average, indicating that higher prices lie ahead. The first horizontal line on the chart is my annual pivot of $44.31, which was a magnet between Jan. 3 and Feb. 14. The second line is my semiannual pivot of $46.75, which was a magnet between Jan. 2 and Feb. 23. My second quarter pivot of $48.77 was tested between April 2 and April 6.

The weekly chart for Intel is positive, with the stock above its five-week modified moving average of $50.91. The stock is well above its 200-week simple moving average of $35.73, also known as the "reversion to the mean," last tested during the week of Feb. 12, 2016, when the average was $27.76. The 12 x 3 x 3 weekly slow stochastic reading is projected to end the week at 75.12, just below the overbought threshold of 80.00.
Given these charts and analysis, investors should buy Intel shares on weakness to my quarterly value level of $48.77 and reduce holdings on strength to my monthly risky level of $59.89. (For more, see: Intel Applies for Patent on Crypto Mining Chip.)
