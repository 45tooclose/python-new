      BREAKING DOWN 'Widow Maker'
      Widow maker is an adaptation of the historical use of the phrase in the forestry and medical industries. For loggers, a widow maker refers to loose limbs, treetops or other logging-related materials lodged overhead and at risk of falling down and killing one or more workers. Medical doctors use the term widow maker to describe a blocked artery likely to cause a patient’s death by severe heart attack. Likewise, traders apply the phrase to financial investments that involve enough risk to cause catastrophic losses.
Example of a widow maker trade
Commodities which experience high price volatility might be considered widow makers since their unpredictable shifts in price could easily wipe out a position, especially when expected future spot prices drift out of alignment with the price of futures contracts. Likewise, the use of leverage, which magnifies both gains and losses on an investment, could generate enough risk to make a trade into a widow maker under the right circumstances.
One of the most famous recent examples of a widow maker trade occurred in natural gas futures, which track the price on delivery for natural gas at the Henry Hub in Louisiana. These contracts have long been termed widow makers by professional traders because of the historic volatility of the price of natural gas. In 2006, a hedge fund called Amaranth Traders made a huge leveraged trade on natural gas futures, trying to repeat its success on a similar speculative trade made a year earlier. Instead, the bottom fell out of the natural gas market and Amaranth lost $6 billion, forcing the hedge fund to liquidate its assets.
Risk and widow maker trades
Excessive risk plays a key factor in widow maker trades. As a general rule, investments likely to offer high returns also hold the potential for heavy losses. Many investors make decisions about their investments based upon the amount of risk they are willing to take on in order to achieve a certain level of return, known as the risk/reward ratio. The energy desk at Amaranth sought higher-than-average rewards by taking on a risky investment prone to unpredictable price changes. Adding leverage to the equation increased that risk further. Because leveraged trades allow investors to control more shares or contracts than their capital outlay would normally allow, they offer potential for higher returns. Unfortunately for Amaranth and others caught on the wrong side of a leveraged trade, it also amplifies the risk of losses.
Wise investors look at highly speculative investments as a gambling ventures and mitigate risk accordingly. Risk mitigation strategies might include investing only a small percentage of total assets in the speculative investment or implementing trading strategies that limit losses.
