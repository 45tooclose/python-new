Cryptocurrency experts remain bullish on the future of major cryptocurrencies. 
Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin have been both good and bad investments. They have been good investments for those who purchased them early on before their big run up, and sold them near their all-time highs, back at the end of last year. But they have been bad investments for those who purchased them near the all-time highs, and either sold them in recent weeks as prices dropped, or continue to hold on to them with heavy losses. 
That’s the past. What about the future? Are major cryptocurrencies good or bad investments? 
Some cryptocurrency experts say ‘good.’ 
Nathan Worsley, CTO of LocalCoinSwap is one of them, though he sees cryptos more as technological innovations rather than get rich quick schemes. “When you invest in any cryptocurrency you should invest in the technology behind it,” says Worsley.“Crypto is not a get-rich-quick scheme, it's a technological revolution with the potential to disrupt the fundamental tenets of global financial systems.”
