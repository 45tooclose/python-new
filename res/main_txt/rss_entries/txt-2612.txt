      BREAKING DOWN 'Reserve Bank of Australia'
      The Reserve Bank of Australia manages the Australian dollar by setting the interest rate in overnight money markets. This interest rate filters through to the rest of the financial system, affecting the rates at which banks will lend to businesses and consumers. The goal of the Reserve Bank of Australia is to set the interest rate low enough to promote maximum Australian employment and economic growth, but not low enough that it sparks inflation above 2% to 3% per year.
The Reserve Bank meets 11 times per year, on the first Tuesday of each month except January, to assess and discuss economic conditions and to decide on interest-rate policy. After the meeting, the bank announces monetary policy decisions, and implements policy through buying and selling of short-term government debt in the open market.
History of the Reserve Bank of Australia
The Reserve Bank of Australia’s history dates back to 1911, when legislation established the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, a decade after the country achieved independence from Great Britain. It was not initially conceived as a central bank, and it was not charged with managing the  Australian currency until 1924, when the Commonwealth Bank Act put it in charge of issuing the Australian pound. Australia retired the Australian pound in 1966, and replaced it with the Australian dollar, which was divided into 100 cents.
Starting in 1967, the Reserve Bank of Australia ceased to peg the Australian British Pound, and instead pegged its value to the U.S. dollar. This relationship between the U.S. dollar and the Australian dollar continued until 1983, when the Aussie was allowed to freely float based on supply and demand in international money markets. The Australian dollar has become a popular currency with foreign exchange traders, who value it for its ability to hedge risks associated with more broadly traded currencies.
