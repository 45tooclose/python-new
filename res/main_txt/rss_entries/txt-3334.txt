      The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) .BK is the full service equities, fixed income and derivatives exchange of the country. The concept of an exchange traces its roots back to the early 1960s, when the country implemented its first 5-year economic development plan. However, the first exchange failed to survive due to lack of interest, modern equipment and know-how. As the country's economic progress took hold in the 1970s, however, a renewed effort to professionally establish and operate an exchange took place. In 1975, the Securities Exchange of Thailand opened for business. In 1991, the name changed to the Stock Exchange of Thailand and the year after, the government introduced the Securities and Exchange Act of 1992 to formalize a more comprehensive set of regulations. Since then, Thailand, one of the next generation of so-called "Asian tigers," has proceeded along a path of economic growth, bringing the development of capital markets — and thus, integral organizations such as the Stock Exchange of Thailand — along with it.
