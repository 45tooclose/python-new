The Heavy Hand of CSRC
Capital markets in China are still in development, and there are those who dare flaunt the laws. Just like in the U.S. with the SEC, the CSRC will stamp out illegal practices whenever it finds them. In March 2018 the CSRC levied a record 5.67 billion yuan (approximately $900 million) fine on a domestic company for manipulating the share prices of newly-listed banks. Numerous other cases have also led to disgorgement, penalties, bans from trading and jail time. Even CSRC had to police its own. In 2017, the head of the IPO division of the Shenzhen and Shanghai exchanges was found guilty of corruption in her dealings with the market that she was entrusted to regulate. The penalty: life in prison.
