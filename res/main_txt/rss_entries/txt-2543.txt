After two years of decline, remittances to low and middle income countries around the world rebounded in 2017, according to the World Bank's latest Migration and Development brief. Remittances to low and middle-income countries reached an estimated $466 billion, an 8.5 percent increase on $429 billion in 2016. Global remittances also grew 7 percent to $613 billion in 2017. Reasons for the global remittance rebound include higher oil prices and the strengthening of the euro and ruble. 
The top recipient countries for remittances in 2017 in dollar terms were India ($69 billion), China ($64 billion) and the Philippines ($33 billion). Despite that massive flow of cash, remittances tend to make a much bigger impact in smaller and poorer nations. When remittances are taken as a share of gross domestic product, the top countries worldwide last year were Kyrgyzstan (35 percent), Tonga (33 percent), Tajikistan (31 percent), Haiti (29 percent) and Nepal (29 percent).
