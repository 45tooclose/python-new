      Breaking Down 'Series 28'
      According to FINRA, the Series 28 "assesses the competency of an entry-level financial and operations principal (FINOP) candidate to perform his or her job as a FINOP in an introducing broker-dealer that does not carry customer accounts or hold customer funds or securities."
The Series 28 is one of the newer FINRA exams, and it illustrates the fiduciary importance of accurate recordkeeping for investor accounts. With such a wide variety of securities available to retail investors there is a great deal to learn and understand about how each should be recorded and adapted for things like income and principal payments, redemptions, accrued interest, rights and warrants, and many other instances. As such, the Series 28 is intended to assess the competency of entry-level introducing broker-dealer financial and operations principals to safeguard the investor public.
