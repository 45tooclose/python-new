      BREAKING DOWN 'Open Mouth Operations'
      Open mouth operations occur when a central bank’s announcements let markets know where the central banks prefer interest rates to be. The potential use of open market operations by the central bank to attain this target interest rate normally causes the market to react and adjust interest rates without the central bank actually having to take action.
Open mouth operations are often associated with open market operations. Whereas open mouth operations deal with the what the central bank intends to do, open market operations refers to the action taken.
Open Mouth and Open Market Operations
The term open market operations refers to the buying and selling of government securities in the open market in order to expand or contract the amount of money in the banking system as a whole. The Federal Reserve facilitates this process to adjust and manipulate the federal funds rate, which is the rate at which banks borrow reserves from one another. Purchases of Treasury securities inject money into the economy and stimulate growth, while selling those same securities can cause the economy to contract.
Regarded as a flexible tool the Federal Reserve can use to control monetary policy in the U.S., there are several forms of open market operations, the most common of which is the sale of government or treasury department securities. Buying and selling government bonds allows the Fed to control the supply of reserve balances held by banks, which helps the Fed increase or decrease short-term interest rates as needed.
The Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the United States and regulates the U.S. monetary and financial system. It is composed of a central governmental agency in Washington, D.C., the Board of Governors and 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks in major cities throughout the United States. The Federal Reserve, conducting the nation's monetary policy, regulates banking institutions, monitors and protects the credit rights of consumers, maintains the stability of the financial system and provides financial services to the U.S. government.
The Federal Open Market Committee decides monetary policy for the the Federal Reserve. The FOMC enacts its monetary policy by setting a target federal funds rate through open mouth operations and then implementing open market operations, discount rate, or reserve requirement strategies to move the current federal funds rate to target levels. The federal funds rate must be controlled because it affects most other interest rates in the United States, including the prime rate, home loan rates, and car loan rates.
