The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today it has obtained a court order freezing $27 million in trading profits from three affiliates of the founder of the NASDAQ-listed cryptocurrency company, Longfin, for illegally selling unregistered shares. 
The SEC’s Enforcement Division Cyber Unit Chief, Robert Cohen, said the freeze was sought to prevent the profits from being transferred out of the United States. 
In its complaint, the SEC says the three affiliates sold large blocks of their unregistered restricted shares in Longfin in the wake of Longfin’s purchase of a “purported” cryptocurrency trading company, Ziddu.com. 
Longfin began listing its shares on NASDAQ December 13. The Zuddu.com purchase was announced two days later. 
Venkata Meenavalli, the founder, controlling shareholder and CEO of Longfin, also owned at least 92 percent of the company the cryptocurrency trading firm was purchased from, the SEC’s complaint said. 
 
  
AlthoughZiddu.com had no ascertainable value, Longfin's share price quadrupled the day the acquisition was announced to $22.01, last December 15 the complaint claimed. 
The next trading day, December 18, the price jumped to $142.82. 
Between February 8 and March 23, the SEC said one of the affiliates, Amro Izzelden “Andy” Altahwi reaped profits of over $25 million by selling 475,751 Longfin shares, the vast majority he obtained as compensation in September 2017 when the company was private. 
 
According to the SEC, Altahwi was listed as a Longfin director during the firm’s August 2017 roadshow. 
The trading profits freeze was obtained in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. 
The SEC said the investigation of Longfin, Meenavalli, Altahwi and the two others is continuing.
