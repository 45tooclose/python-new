Line, the Japan-based messaging app provider, is planning to build a custom blockchain aimed to boost development of decentralized apps for its platform.
The news was revealed when the company, a subsidiary of South Korea's internet giant Naver, set out its 2018 technology roadmap at its developer event last Friday. At the event, Euivin Park, the firm's chief technology officer, said she aims to take Line's existing blockchain efforts a big step forward by launching a blockchain mainnet.
The platform, as envisioned by Park, would be built outside Line's existing products and utilize the token economy to incentivize and accelerate the development of decentralized applications, either by third parties or the firm's own developers.
To that effort, she said the company is now also moving to recruit more blockchain developers in Japan and South Korea, as well as elsewhere in Southeast Asia. 

The announcement comes just days after the company launched a blockchain subsidiary, called Unblock, based in South Korea. Focusing on blockchain-related R&D initiatives, the new subsidiary was set up to integrate decentralized applications to Line's messaging platform in a bid to add more features for users.
Back in January, the messaging giant also  said it will launch a cryptocurrency exchange to be available through its Line Pay app. The project is currently going through the licensing process with Japan's Financial Services Agency prior to a future launch.
