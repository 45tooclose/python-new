      The gold/silver ratio describes how many ounces of silver it takes to purchase one ounce of gold. Investors use the fluctuating ratio to ascertain the relative value of silver compared to gold, thus determining the optimal time to purchase one metal over the other. It also helps investors diversify their precious-metal holdings.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Gold/Silver Ratio'
      The gold/silver ratio floats constantly as prices shift. Let’s say gold is trading at $300 per ounce and silver is trading at $20 per ounce. The gold/silver ratio would then be 15, as it would take 15 ounces of silver to buy one ounce of gold. If next week the price of gold falls to $250 an ounce and the price of silver rises to $25 per ounce, the ratio drops to 10.
Historically, when currencies were based on gold and silver holdings, the gold/silver ratio was fixed. This was done by central banks to lend stability to monetary markets. For example, during the Roman Empire the gold/silver ratio was fixed at 12. In the 19th Century, the ratio was generally set at 15. But the era of the fixed ratio ended in the twentieth century as nations moved away from the bi-metallic currency standard and, eventually, off the gold standard entirely.
The Gold/Silver Ratio Can Be a Wild Ride
In the modern era the ratio can swing wildly. In the past decade it has moved from a high of 80.61 in December 2008, to a low of 31.53 in April 2011. Over the last 100 years it has shifted even more, from a high of 80.61 in January 1980 to a low of 17.73 in April 1919. Note that the ratio can change even if both gold and silver rise or fall in price, so long as they change at different rates.
As the ratio swings illustrate, the value of gold, silver and other precious metals such as platinum and palladium is highly dependent on their relative scarcity as goods. The markets are highly speculative because unlike stocks or bonds they are not based on underlying performance measures; however, unlike other speculative commodity markets such as the oil market, gold and silver are non-consumable. Even when used in such things as jewelry, their value can be recovered. In part because they don’t go away, precious metals have traditionally been viewed as a safe haven for investors when other markets are experiencing high rates of volatility.
Trading the Ratio
So-called hard asset investors can take advantage of the ratio swings by trading the ratio, which essentially means trading gold for silver when the ratio rises, thus meaning silver is cheaper, and trading silver for gold when the ratio drops and gold becomes cheaper.
