      BREAKING DOWN 'Short Gold ETF'
      Short gold ETFs use futures contracts to gain exposure and essentially provide a synthetic short position in gold. Each day, a short gold ETF's price is adjusted by -100% of the daily percentage change in the price of gold. The price of gold may be based on the price of a gold index, physical gold, gold futures contracts or gold mining stocks for a short gold ETF's purposes. An investor would buy a short gold ETF if he or she expected the price of gold to decline. 
Many people move portions of their assets out of stocks and bonds and into gold during uncertain market conditions because it historically has low positive or negative correlations to traditional asset classes. The precious metal maintains its value during volatile markets and can hedge against inflation, macroeconomic and geopolitical risk. Because of these characteristics, many individual investors, institutions and nations have long viewed the metal as a safe harbor for their wealth. However, some investors may want to bet against these conditions and against gold by going short. 
What traders should know about Short Gold ETFs
Market environments when investors have a strong appetite for equities, optimism predominates, and economic growth is strong may be a good time to consider a short gold ETF. However, if investor sentiment turns pessimistic and safe havens like gold and other commodities come into vogue, a short gold ETF would not be a smart place to put one’s money.
Short gold ETFs can have significant variations in the amount of leverage, also known as magnification, that’s being employed. This amount is included in their descriptions and is generally -1x, -2x, or -3x. Inverse ETFs use derivatives in an attempt to achieve a negative, or inverse, multiplier to the direction of the underlying asset or index, and they would typically rebalance on a daily basis. The ETF strategies help get in on tactical short-term opportunities. Additionally, these products are more suitable for those with a high risk tolerance.
Traders should also know that inverse and leveraged products are not suitable for long-term buy-and-hold investors as the compounding affects from the daily rebalances would create divergences from the ETF’s performance to that of the underlying index, especially over periods of high volatility. They should also bear in mind that a short gold ETF is essentially an uncollateralized loan to an investment bank and leaves investors open to potential credit risks of the issuing bank – if the bank goes under, there is no guarantee that the investor will receive all of his or her principle back.
