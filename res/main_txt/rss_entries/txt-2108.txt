The new development will see the group grow its IT Development and Support operations, in light of increasing demand in Europe and Asia.Match-Trade’s office has been in operation for over a year now, initially launching back in January 2017. Led by Michael Karczewski, its operations and market footprint have steadily grown, securing new business in both Europe and Asia. Per the expansion, the new office will be located at Warsaw Trade Tower building on Chlodna 51 street.The move represents the second such expansion for Match-Trade in less than a year, with the group also recently launching an office in Malaysia back in November. Its Warsaw office is strategically located and will now be responsible for overseeing a sizable part of Match-Trade’s various technology initiatives.Poland is increasingly becoming an enticing location for various tech startups and other venues, given its skilled workforce, low labor costs, and highly developed IT infrastructure. This appears to have been a driving force behind Match-Trade’s operational launch in the region, culminating in today’s expansion.In tandem with the move, Match-Trade will also be making a new senior appointment. Krzysztof Dankowski will be tapped as its newest Head of Business Development, helping coordinate and lead the majority of the company’s IT projects. Mr. Dankowski steps into the role with over nine years of experience across the FX segment, including an emphasis in trading and information technology at X-Trade Brokers.Imran Firoz, Managing Director Match-Trade, commented on the move: “Krzysztof is an excellent addition to our Team who will play an integral part in the success of Match-Trade, and our ability to grow and gain market share. He brings deep knowledge in developing OTC products, building trading infrastructure, and managing large information technology department while working with the top rated FX & CFD Broker.”Of note, Poland has been one of the countries to see the largest shift in FX regulation over the past year. Even before the recent crackdown from ESMA in March, the Polish Ministry of Finance had been ahead of the curve, having taken extensive efforts to mitigate the maximum leverage on FX trading. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: fx / IT / Match-Trade Technologies / poland / WarsawRelated News XTB Proceeding With Plans to Leave Turkish Market  Long Blockchain Clarifies Plans, Appoints Stater’s Ramy Soliman to Board  TradeFred Integrating Leverate’s Trading Platform and Marketing Solution  Got a news tip?
