      BREAKING DOWN 'SelfKey (KEY)'
      Real-world identity data management systems are large and mostly owned and managed by governments, or by large organizations like banks, social media networks, and shopping portals. However, every now and then issues of security, privacy, ownership, access, protection, and interoperability arise. A bigger issue is that users are never in control of their own identity records.
SelfKey attempts to address these problems by allowing users full control of their identity, by using open-source, user-centric, decentralized, blockchain-based data management mechanisms.
SelfKey network is supported by its own native currency which is compatible to ERC-20 standard, and is traded under the symbol KEY. (For more, see Why Crypto Users Need to Know: The ERC20 Standard)
The network also offers an identity wallet which can be used to store KEY cryptocoins as well as the user's identification documents. Such documents can be validated by authorized entities like notaries, and can then be used as valid KYC documents for a variety of requirements like opening of bank accounts.
The identity owner sends identity claims and tokens to the certifier or attester, who sends the attested certified claims back to the identity owner. Such a validated document, accompanied by the necessary amount of tokens, is sent by the identity owner to the third party that needs KYC compliance. This party then sends the tokens to the certifier, along with confirmation of successful KYC compliance to the identity holder, as the customer on-boarding gets completes. The validator receives tokens for his service both from the identity owner and from the relying party.
This decentralized method provides security from data and identity theft, and offers digital freedom to authenticate an identity in the fast moving internet age.
How Does SelfKey Work?
Technically, SelfKey works as follows. A user downloads the SelfKey wallet, and stores a public and a private key. The public key can be freely shared for any verification needs, while the private key is held by the user to store digital identity documents in the wallet. The user sends the public key and identity document to the certifier and requests certification. The certifier verifies and sends back the signed document with the user’s public key back to the owner, who can now use the certified document with any third party as needed.
The SelfKey marketplace offers a host of services to the user which includes incorporation, residency, citizenship by investment, money transfer services, international insurance, cryptocoin trading, e-wallets, and bank account setups. The future roadmap includes offering more services around forex dealings, payment processing, P2P credit, business loans, personal loans and mortgages. The platform also provides for community discussion and maintaining feedback about various service providers, making it more transparent and reliable.
