AngelList, a website for startups offering vacancies to job seekers and investment opportunities for angel investors, reported that the number of crypto job openings has doubled in the past three months, according to their weekly newsletter published Thursday, April 19.
According to data from AngelList’s newsletter - this week titled “Bitcoin is (not) dead” - the number of new jobs related to cryptocurrency listed in December 2017, when Bitcoin (BTC) reached a peak of $20,000, was around 500. After BTC crashed below below $7000 in February of this year, the number of new crypto job postings was more than 1000, for, as Angellist jokes, “[s]tartups aren't watching the markets.”

AngelList had earlier predicted in an as-of-yet un-updated post entitled, “How to Get a Job in Crypto,” that by 2017 there would be over 1200 crypto job postings, a number set to be broken this year.
The newsletter also mentions that Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) were very popular in March, and cryptocurrency hedge funds are taking the place of venture capital investors in this new investment model.
CoinList, a spin-off of AngelList comprised of a platform for token-based financial services with an emphasis on complying with regulation, raised $9.2 mln during its initial fundraising round in early April.
In their newsletter, AngelList lists three companies hiring in the field of “Decentralized Finance,” three in “Security Hardware,” and three in “Decentralized Internet.” Last December, Cointelegraph wrote about the various new kinds of job opportunities in crypto in 2018, including in development, law, and design.
