The House Judiciary Committee will vote on the bipartisan package of reforms this week.Trade organizations for the music business and technology companies are proposing a new system to compensate songwriters, who have complained about their treatment for years. Spotify Technology SA, Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Pandora Media Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. would create a database of songs and support a trio of judges who would determine songwriter royalty rates.
