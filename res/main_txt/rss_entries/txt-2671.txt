            President Donald Trump alleged that former FBI Director James Comey is guilty of leaking classified information to prompt a special counsel’s appointment and accused his own Justice Department of engaging in a “witch hunt” against him."Comey is a leaker, and he’s a liar. And not only on this stuff. He’s been leaking for years." Trump said in a call-in interview with Fox’s program “Fox & Friends” on Thursday. "He leaked classified information in order to try and get a special counsel."The president said that he had so far taken a hands-off position with regard to the Justice Department, which has appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and whether the Trump campaign was involved. But he indicated in the interview that he may change his mind.

        “They have a witch hunt against the president of the United States going on,” Trump said. “I’ve taken the position -- and I don’t have to take this position and maybe I’ll change --that I will not be involved with the Justice Department. I will wait until this is over. It’s a total -- it’s all lies and it’s a horrible thing that’s going on.""I’m very disappointed in my Justice Department," he said.Trump had to be reminded by the Fox hosts that it is his administration’s Justice Department led by someone he nominated, Attorney General Jeff Sessions.Trump had praised Comey for his honorable conduct during the 2016 campaign, solicited his loyalty, and asked him to let go of an investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, according to memos turned over to House lawmakers last week that Comey wrote to document private conversations between the two.After the contents of the memos were released, Trump wrote on Twitter that they "show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION.”

        Trump and Comey have traded shots since the days before the release of the former lawman’s book "A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership." Trump’s called Comey a "slimeball" and accused him of improperly leaking information. Last week, the president called Comey’s book "third-rate" and lamented that Flynn’s life was destroyed while "Shadey James Comey" can make lots of money.Comey has said he did not leak any classified information when he provided one of his memos to a friend. As recently as a CNN town hall last night, he said Trump isn’t morally fit for office and denied leaking the memos improperly.
