Crypto wallet Blockchain.info has hired former Goldman Sachs executive Breanne Madigan as the head of institutional sales and strategy, CNBC reports today, April 17.
Madigan had worked at Goldman Sachs from 2003 to 2017 as an associate, vice president, and finally as the head of institutional wealth services, a department that managed $1.49 trln worth of total assets in 2017, CNBC reports.
Blockchain.info, which has 24 mln active wallets according to CNBC, added a buy and sell feature for Bitcoin (BTC) – with Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) promised soon after – in 22 US states in mid-January of this year.
Peter Smith, the CEO of Blockchain.info, said in a statement that "Breanne has a proven track record of adding value to her teams and her clients,” continuing:

“As Blockchain continues to grow its institutional presence, I can think of no one better to help scale our business.”

In what seems to be a growing trend of former Wall Street talent and money moving to the crypto sphere, a report circulated last week that Goldman Sachs executive Richard Kim would be hired as the new chief operating officer of a crypto merchant bank founded and run by former Wall Street executive Mike Novogratz. A little more than a week ago, George Soros’s Fund Management has been reported to soon begin trading in crypto, and the Rockefeller’s venture capital arm formed a partnership with a crypto investment group to support Blockchain and crypto innovation.
