  In its current form, the Ponder app is an online dating platform, but with a slight twist. Typical dating apps like Hinge or Tinder use complex algorithms to mine user profiles for information and suggest matches based on similar interests and other criteria. In contrast, the Ponder app lets its users “play cupid” by setting up a network of “matchmakers” and “matchees”. If a matchmaker successfully pairs friends or singles in their matchmaking group, he or she wins $10. If a marriage results, the matchmaker can win up to $1,000.
Not content to go with the flow, however, the Ponder team is working on a blockchain powered upgrade that will add several key features to the already thriving platform. The goal is for the app to be a decentralized referrals platform, allowing for users to set up matches for any purpose and in any industry. The implementation of blockchain technology will enable Ponder to expand beyond a simple dating service into a full-fledged matching and networking system.

The blockchain upgrade will center on the development of the platform’s crypto token, Ponder Gold (PON). PON will be used in all transactions within the Ponder ecosystem, allowing users from anywhere in the world to connect and interact. As a decentralized digital currency, PON will remove the need for expensive financial intermediaries and streamline any interactions that deal with a transfer of value--such as receiving compensation for making a successful match.
Another key feature will be the integration of smart contracts. By having self-executing contracts written into the platform’s infrastructure, all transactions will be secure and decentralized. As a result, matchmakers won’t have to worry about receiving payment once they make a match--the system is written to automatically issue their matchmaking reward. PON, as an Ethereum based token, will also have fungibility as well as transferability, and can be exchanged for most other cryptocurrencies.
Overall, the newly upgraded Ponder app will provide its customer base with a brand new matchmaking experience. Those that want to find love through online dating services can use the Ponder app and join sub-communities tailored to their specific desires. Instead of sorting through matches created by an impersonal algorithm, users will be paired by matchmakers who have financial incentives to perform well, bringing a personal, intimate element to the online dating industry.
What’s more, the decentralized Ponder ecosystem will be ideal for other types of matches, such as business head hunters and other networking opportunities. Ponder will provide a more cost-effective, secure medium for connecting employers with potential employees. Employers will enjoy the personal aspect, in contrast to rifling through thousands of generic online applications, while job-seeking employees will be able to connect with employers through knowledgeable matchmakers who have their best interests in mind.
