      The OPEC basket is also known as the OPEC reference basket, or the OPEC reference basket of crudes. Sometimes this is abbreviated as ORB.  OPEC stands for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The OPEC basket is a weighted average of oil prices from the different OPEC members around the world. The basket is used as a reference point for those monitoring the price of oil and the stability of oil markets globally.
Today, the ORB is averaged by considering the price of oil from the following countries: Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela. These fourteen countries represent the complete membership of OPEC. Though many other countries throughout the world also produce oil, not all of them are members of OPEC. Russia, the U.S., China, and Canada are all major oil producers but not OPEC members. OPEC’s member countries produce in total 40 percent of the world’s oil.

      BREAKING DOWN 'OPEC Basket'
      The OPEC basket is based on specific oil blends from OPEC member countries. Some of these oils have higher sulfur content than oils from other countries. Because of this, the OPEC basket is generally priced lower than other oil reference prices. For example, West Texas Intermediate crude oil, also known as WTI, is a lighter, higher quality oil, and so it usually sells for about $5 to $6 higher than the OPEC basket price. The Brent blend comes from drilling in the North Sea.  This oil is generally refined in Northwestern Europe and is sold at about $4 above the OPEC basket.  
Oil prices matter a great deal to the global economy, because the production and distribution of all consumer goods depends on petroleum. Oil fuels the trucks that transport goods, the tractors that plow agricultural fields, the cars that consumers use to get to the market and much more. OPEC was created as a way for oil-producing countries to create stable market conditions for themselves by raising or lowering production in accordance with demand and availability.
The OPEC basket price today
On April 26, 2018, the ORB stood at $71 per barrel. This represents a steady rise over the previous month. On March 26, 2018, the ORB was $66.80. A year prior, it stood at about $51.47, and rose steadily throughout 2017. However, the average price per barrel for the past ten years has stood fairly close to $76. This means that the recent rise has brought prices back toward the average for the last decade.
