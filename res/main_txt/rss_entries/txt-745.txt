        The escalating tensions have weighed on investors, with crude prices hovering the highest levels since 2014. Oil producers and insurance companies led gainers on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, helping blunt the more downbeat sentiment from Asia, where equity benchmarks from Tokyo to Sydney fell.— With assistance by Andrey Biryukov
