            London (AP) -- British media report that Yulia Skripal, one of two Russians poisoned by nerve agent, has been released from the hospital.
BBC News said Tuesday the 33-year-old Skripal had been discharged from hospital and taken to a "secure" location on Monday.
Skripal was in critical condition after the March 4 nerve agent attack, apparently aimed at her father, Sergei Skripal.
