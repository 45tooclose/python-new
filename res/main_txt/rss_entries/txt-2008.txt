            There’s at least one aspect of Brexit negotiations the European Union is grateful for: having Theresa May as prime minister rather than the bookmakers’ favorite to replace her, arch-euroskeptic Jacob Rees-Mogg.European commissioners aren’t supposed to stray into domestic affairs, but Ireland’s man on Brussels’ 28-strong executive couldn’t resist after being asked about Rees-Mogg’s claim that the British government could place tariffs of up to 70 percent on Irish beef if it doesn’t secure a wider Brexit deal.#lazy-img-326881984:before{padding-top:66.64999999999999%;}Jacob Rees-MoggPhotographer: Chris J.

        “That’s why we’re very pleased in the European Union that we’re dealing with the prime minister of the United Kingdom, not with Mr. Rees-Mogg,” Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan told a news conference in Brussels on Monday.

        Rees-Mogg, a backbench lawmaker in May’s Conservatives, emerged from the 2016 referendum as the party’s leading voice against watering down Brexit. He’s regularly tipped as a future leader should May be ousted.He said that high tariffs on Irish beef would “bankrupt Ireland,” that the U.K. wouldn’t pay the 39 billion pounds ($54 billion) Brexit financial settlement if it didn’t get a deal and that it isn’t Britain’s responsibility to find a solution to keep the Irish border invisible.And as for the substance of those remarks?“We’re not going to speculate on a lot of speculative statements that he makes on a regular basis,” Hogan said.
