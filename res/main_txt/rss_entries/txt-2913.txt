      BREAKING DOWN 'Josef Ackermann'
      Born in Walenstadt, Canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland in 1948, Josef Ackermann attended the University of St. Gallen, where he studied economics and social sciences. Upon completing his undergraduate studies, Ackermann remained at the University of St. Gallen as a research assistant with the Department of Economics; he eventually earned his Ph.D. in economics. Early on, he was encouraged to go into both academic and military careers, but he began his career as a corporate banker with Credit Suisse in 1977.
Ackermann served as CEO of Deutsche Bank from 2002 to 2012. As CEO, he introduced to Deutsche Bank a new shareholder-focused management style, helped the company expand internationally and increased its focus on investment banking. He earned €9.4 million in 2009 and €8.8 million in 2010, according to Financial Times Deutschland. Ackermann received bonuses of €8.2 million and €7.1 million in those two years respectively. When faced with sanctions from the U.S. Justice Department in 2015, Deutsche Bank reportedly attempted to reclaim tens of millions of Euros in bonuses paid to Ackermann and five other former CEOs.
