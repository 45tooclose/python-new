            Gabon’s Constitutional Court dissolved the central African nation’s parliament and urged the president to name a transitional government because a deadline to hold legislative elections by April 30 wasn’t met.Parliament’s functions will be taken over by the Senate until the vote, initially scheduled for December 2016, is held, the Libreville-based news site GabonActu reported, citing a statement Monday by Marie-Madeleine Mborantsuo, the president of the Constitutional Court. Mborantsuo also said the government should resign because it hasn’t been able to update the voter’s roll and establish a new electoral commission within the deadline. The Constitutional Court is set to announce a date for the legislative vote as soon as the members of the new commission have been sworn in. The last vote was held in 2011.
