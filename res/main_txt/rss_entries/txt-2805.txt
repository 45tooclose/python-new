      BREAKING DOWN 'Grantee'
      A county grantor-grantee index provides a record of real estate transfers showing who released ownership of a property and who took ownership. The index also shows the location of the property and the type of document used to transfer ownership (e.g., quitclaim deed, trust deed, tax lien, etc.). Typically, the index is maintained by the county recorder.
