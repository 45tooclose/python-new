            Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani joined Donald Trump’s personal legal team, the president’s top lawyer said Thursday.“Rudy is great,” Trump said in a statement released by Jay Sekulow, his lawyer. “He has been my friend for a long time and wants to get this matter quickly resolved for the good of the country.”Giuliani, contacted by telephone, confirmed he is joining the legal team and said he is taking a “very brief” leave of absence from his firm to assist the president in dealing with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.

        “My job is going to be to try to get him what he needs to wrap it up,” Giuliani said. “I know everybody involved, maybe they’ll trust me. ”In recent weeks, Trump has struggled to attract talent to his legal team and last month lost one of the key lawyers representing him.The addition of Giuliani, who campaigned for Trump and has been an informal adviser to the president, comes after an FBI raid on Michael Cohen, Trump’s longtime lawyer.Sekulow said that Jane Serene Raskin and Marty Raskin are also joining the legal team.Trump has few senior attorneys on his team. Ty Cobb runs the White House’s response to the Russia probe and Jay Sekulow, a talk radio host known for arguing First Amendment cases, is leading the president’s personal team.

        The previous head of that team, John Dowd, quit last month amid disagreements about strategy. Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing were announced as new hires to Trump’s team that week, but the president reversed course, with one of his other lawyers saying that conflicts precluded them from joining the team representing him in the Russia probe.Giuliani, who was U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York in the 1980s and ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, was rumored to be under consideration to be Trump’s attorney general. Instead, Trump named the former mayor an informal adviser on cybersecurity issues.— With assistance by Margaret Talev
