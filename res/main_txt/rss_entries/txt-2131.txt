            The Kremlin struck a skeptical tone about the unexpected move by the U.S. Treasury to ease sanctions imposed on United Co. Rusal, even as aluminum prices dropped and shares in the metals giant rebounded.“I’d be very cautious because these statements are of an absolutely hypothetical nature,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on a conference call Tuesday, denouncing the sanctions as “comparable to economic raiding.”The Treasury Monday announced that it was giving U.S. and other companies another five months to wind down contracts with Rusal and would consider the Russian company’s appeal to be removed from the sanctions list. Rusal could get a reprieve if tycoon Oleg Deripaska, the main target of the sanctions, relinquishes control, according to the Treasury. The news sent a wave of relief through metals markets thrown into turmoil by the original April 6 decision to ban all U.S. entities from transactions with Deripaska, Rusal and other companies in his empire.

        In the weeks since, the Russian government has been scrambling to come up with ways to protect Rusal, which employs more than 60,000 people and is a major exporter. Russia also is readying a package of retaliatory measures against U.S. companies and trade, though the Kremlin last week put the brakes on that plan to give time for more analysis.“The signals coming from Washington now are very contradictory, so it’s hard to make any kind of conclusions,” Peskov said. Overall, however, “we’d like the situation to be better,” he said.
