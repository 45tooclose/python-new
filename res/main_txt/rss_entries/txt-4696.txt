      BREAKING DOWN 'Public Purpose Bond'
      A public purpose bond is a specific kind of municipal bond that funds a public project. As opposed to other municipal bonds, a public purpose bond finances public work projects that do not attract private investment or produce revenue.  Public purpose bonds are generally employed to fund such projects as road construction and maintenance, libraries, swimming pools and other municipal facilities. Public purpose bonds are exempt from federal income taxes and were first defined by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. In order to issue a public purpose bond, a municipality must be able to tax their residents, plus eminent domain or police power.
Public purpose bonds are a kind of municipal bond classified as a general obligation bond, which is a bond backed by the credit and taxing power of the issuing jurisdiction as opposed to a a bond backed from the revenue any given project. As general obligation bonds, public purpose bonds do not require assets for collateral; instead the municipalities issue the bonds with the belief that they will be able to repay their debt obligation through taxation or revenue from projects.
Public Purpose vs. Private Purpose Bonds
Whereas public purpose bonds require the majority of the project funded benefit the public at large, a private purpose bond is a municipal bond that finances a project for which at least 10% of the benefit will go to a private sector entity.
The 1986 Tax Reform Act requires municipal bonds to be categorized as either public purpose or private purpose bonds. Municipal bonds are often tax-free income. The reform act’s division of the two different bonds enables the government to tax interest payments that investors receive from private purpose bonds taxable unless the bonds are specifically exempted.
For example, a city is hoping to attract economic investment, and wants a corporation to open its new headquarters in the town. In order to attract the corporation, the city could issue a municipal bond and lend the corporation the money to build their new headquarters, hoping it will create jobs and stimulate the city’s economy. By issuing the bonds, the corporation is able to borrow funds at a much lower interest rate than a bank would offer, and the city benefits with economic growth. The income any investors make off of this bond, however, is taxable because a corporation generates income.
