(M) increased their holdings by 13.14% in the last 12 months, according to data compiled by Morningstar. With an $9.4 billion market cap and operating some 852 stores under the Macy's, Bloomingdale's, and Bluemercury brands, the company is one of the biggest and most legendary retailers in American history, but has had a rough few years. As the shopping public increasingly moves online to sites like Amazon.com, Macy's and other retail giants are looking for new ways to survive. (See also: 8 Companies Amazon Is Killing.)
The company posted strong Q4 2017 earnings in late February 2018, earning $1.21 billion during the holiday quarter. This is a huge improvement over the same quarter a year before, when the company earned $815 million. Macy's stock soared on this news, and these top three shareholders will be watching closely to see if this reversal of fortune isn't a fluke. All data is courtesy of Morningstar.
