      A Renewable Energy Certificate or REC is a market-based instrument that certifies the bearer owns one megawatt-hour, or MWh, of electricity generated from a renewable energy resource. Once the electricity provider has fed the electricity into the grid, the REC they receive can then be sold on the open market as a commodity.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Renewable Energy Certificate - REC'
      Since electricity generated from renewable energy sources cannot be distinguished from any other electricity once it flows into the power grid, RECs provide an accounting and tracking mechanism for solar, wind and other forms of green power. This is necessary because electricity is difficult and expensive to store in batteries, so most renewable-generated power is fed back into the power grid for immediate use by other customers. The provider of the renewable electricity, such as a homeowner with rooftop solar panels,  then receives RECs that can be sold or more typically used as credit against their own power usage.
Many states require power utilities to purchase or generate renewable solar power. These requirements are called solar carveouts. Moreover, many states have a Renewable Portfolio Standard or RPS which requires utilities to generate a certain amount of renewable power that increases every year. These RPS requirements are a major driver of REC trades.
While state laws vary on the use and sale of RECs, the certificates are recognized by many state and local governments as well as regional electricity transmission authorities, NGOs and trade groups. They are variously known as Green Tags, Tradable Renewable Certificates or TRCs, and Renewable Energy Credits. Besides solar and wind generated power, RECs can be issued for generators of geothermal, hydro-power without dams, biofuels and hydrogen fuel cells.
Renewable Energy Credits in the Marketplace
REC arbitrage, also called REC swaps, involve the near-simultaneous buying and selling of RECs with differing prices, in an attempt to profit from the disparity. For example, State A might have higher RPS requirements and solar carveouts than State B, thus driving up demand for solar power, and the price per REC, in State A. A provider of solar power in State A therefore has an incentive to purchase cheaper replacement RECs from State B, then use those RECs for its energy claim in State A. Note that a REC is always the same amount of electricity: what varies is the price. In practice REC arbitrage is typically facilitated my broker middlemen, but the market allows renewable energy providers to economize on energy production as well as reduce carbon emissions by encouraging more green energy production.
