Data privacy has been a hot topic lately. The revelation that millions of Facebook users’ data were breached by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica has sent a jolt through the tech world.  
With the amount of data people provide to companies like Facebook, it’s essential to have ways to protect information and keep sensitive data safe. And zk-SNARKs are a valuable weapon in the battle for privacy and security.  
Known for its widespread use in Zcash, zk-SNARK is an acronym for “zero-knowledge, Succinct, Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge.”  
 
  
It’s a mouthful to say, but its capabilities are simple. zk-SNARK is a form of cryptography that proves possession of certain information without revealing that information, and without any interaction between the prover and verifier. 
For example, individuals could use zk-SNARK proofs to prove their bank accounts hold a certain amount of money. But the proofs wouldn’t reveal the exact amount of money in the accounts. Only that they did—or did not—meet a certain monetary threshold.  
 
These proofs are allowing blockchain companies to build smarter, automated systems that can attest to certain facts without revealing the data behind those facts. 
That’s important because while greater transparency has long been the goal of many blockchain advocates, transparency has its limits. Both companies and individuals have reasons to keep sensitive information private, while still reaping the benefits of a decentralized blockchain network. 
And zk-SNARKs are helping to do just that.
