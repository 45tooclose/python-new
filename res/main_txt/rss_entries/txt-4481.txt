      An eligible commercial entity is a type of contract participant that has a certain set of abilities and responsibilities with regard to futures trading. These include being able to make or take delivery of a specified commodity and manage and incur risk, including price risk. This party may also regularly provide hedging services and may be a market maker for the specified commodities.
Individual people cannot become eligible commercial entities, nor can instruments of the state. Eligible commercial entities may be financial institutions, investment firms, or insurance brokers. Whether or not an entity is qualified to be an eligible commercial entity is determined by the regulations set forth under the Commodities Exchange Act.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Eligible Commercial Entity'
      Eligible commercial entities participate in futures trading. Futures trading is regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. When people participate in futures trading, they are promising to buy or sell a specific product at a predetermined price at a certain date. Thus, the futures market is based on speculation and predictions of how the market will look at a certain point in the future.
How eligible commercial entities come into play
A national bread company may suspect that grain prices are going to shoot up in the coming year because the weather has been unpredictable in recent months. However, the company wants to lock in a good price on wheat for when it needs more later in the year. The company would then contact a financial institution that is an eligible commercial entity. A broker from that institution will be able to help the bread company secure a futures contract for wheat.
The broker should have a knowledge of the wheat market and a sense of how it fluctuates. With their specialized knowledge, the broker can advise the bread company to purchase 500 tons of wheat on the futures market, offering $175 per ton. If they enter into a contract to do so, theyâ€™ll pay that exact price at a date six months from now. The broker has reason to believe that the price of wheat will not dip significantly over the next six months, so this is a fairly safe deal for the bread company.
The wheat will then get delivered on the set date and the company will pay $175 per ton. However, over the next six months, the price of wheat on the open market could skyrocket or fall considerably. Either way, neither the bread company nor the wheat producers will be affected by the new prices, because of the futures contract they are locked into.
