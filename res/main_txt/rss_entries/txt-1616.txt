            Michael Cohen, the longtime personal attorney for President Donald Trump, dropped his defamation lawsuits against Buzzfeed and the investigative firm Fusion GPS over a dossier of information about contacts between Trump and Russia.Cohen, in two court filings late Wednesday, elected to end the lawsuits he filed in January, which claimed the dossier contained a series of false assertions about him. His decision to end the lawsuits in their early stages came as he faces a criminal investigation by federal prosecutors in New York over his private finances and business dealings. By dropping the cases, he wonâ€™t have to answer detailed questions in the litigation over his own activities.
