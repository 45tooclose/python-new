The company is not registered as a legitimate ‎provider in Austria and is therefore not allowed to offer ‎financial services in the country.‎The FMA is an integrated supervisory authority ‎established in 2002. It brings together the supervision of ‎all financial providers and functions in Austria under a ‎single roof. The regulator is focused on identifying and ‎blacklisting any individual or entity that is operating in ‎Austria without a licence or authorisation, where that is ‎required by law.‎The FMA updates the public by means of warnings and ‎alerts when it believes that investors may be at risk. ‎Businesses and individuals are named on this list if they ‎are not registered to provide financial services in Austria ‎and/or had the FMA enforce action against them for ‎misconduct.‎ googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: Bitcoin Scam / crypto ban / fmaRelated News Cloud Mining Put to the Test- Is It Worth Your Money?
