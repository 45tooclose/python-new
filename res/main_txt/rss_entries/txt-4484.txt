      Agroforestry is the integration of trees and shrubs with open-space agriculture so land can simultaneously be used for more than one purpose. Agrofrestry has been practiced around the world since the dawn of farming, but in the developed world has been largely replaced by large-scale monoculture farming. Today the practice is getting renewed attention in both developed and developing countries.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Agroforestry'
      Agroforestry benefits are economic, environmental and even social. Trees are themselves a crop, whether harvested for wood or to grow fruit, which includes olives, nuts and their oils. When planted alongside open-space annual crops such as corn, wheat and legumes, trees can provide more steady income for landowners since all of their harvest is not tied to a few crops or a single season. Agroforestry can also make it easier for farmers to transition from one type of crop to another as market demand for their products changes. This crop diversity is also important for so-called food security, since a wide range of crops serves as protection against catastrophic loss should any one crop be destroyed by a pest, virus or drought.
Climate Change Spurs Agroforestry
As global warming desiccates formerly productive agricultural regions in many parts of the world, farmers are planting trees to shelter both crops and livestock from the sun and to retain moisture in the ground. In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, tall banana trees, which are a lucrative commercial crop, are interplanted with smaller oil palms. The latter crop yield a valuable cooking oil and even lower-growing cassava and pineapple. While this type of mixed farming has been traditional in the developing world, farmers are working with agricultural experts to plant more trees and increase crop yields through sustainable agroforestry.
Knowledge Is Key
Agroforestry does require more planning and know-how than simpler land uses because the system must take into consideration the diverse and sometimes contradictory needs of each component. For example, grazing cattle can damage a tree’s root system. On the other hand, some crops thrive in the shade of overhanging trees, such as mushrooms, ramps and cocoa.
The United States Department of Agriculture, or USDA, has initiated the Agroforesty Strategic Framework to develop and promote agroforestry. The program brings together scientists, landowners and other USDA partners in applying research and technology to the practice. The goals include rural prosperity, food security, forest and open-space conservation and sustainable farming.
