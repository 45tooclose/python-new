The latest contention involving both the largest US exchange Coinbase and p2p platform Localbitcoins has led online commentators to actively seek decentralized alternatives.Cryptocurrency most important areas for improvement over the next few years:* More secure storage (key management)* Trust-minimized (decentralized) exchanges* Make 2nd layers more user-friendly, especially via automated routing, while not overly sacrificing trust minimization— Nick Szabo⚡️ (@NickSzabo4) April 24, 2018Layer 2 Needs A FaceliftMeanwhile, while so-called second layer (Layer 2) solutions continue to revolutionize the Bitcoin user experience, Szabo calls for these to be made much more “user-friendly” on the front end.A case in point for this is the Lightning Network. While users can already make near-instant Bitcoin transactions for less than one satoshi in fees, the reality remains that using Lightning requires a level of technical proficiency which is off-putting for lay consumers.Developers are already getting to grips with the issue, however, while LN’s popularity has been proven in the doubling of its capacity in the last two weeks alone to over $150,000.What do you think about Nick Szabo’s suggestions?
