At the time, the legal firm representing the plaintiff suggested the RBI had acted without “logic.”“The circular appears to be arbitrary and unconstitutional since it does not give strong facts as to why RBI is against the business of cryptocurrencies,” Quartz quoted a partner as saying. The partner added:Logical and well-thought argument backed by solid facts are the primary requirements under the constitution to put a stop to any business in India.Traders Still in LimboFlintstone has since adopted a similar tone, railing against the harsh knock-on effects to the Indian crypto industry in view of demands that banks stop serving affected clients as soon as July.In his petition to the Delhi High Court, Lakhanpal stated:…These arbitrary decisions by regulators and certain financial institutions have jeopardized our business interests.
