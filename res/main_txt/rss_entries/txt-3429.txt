            Amber Rudd quit as U.K. Home Secretary late Sunday after successive rows tied to her office’s mishandling of immigrants from the Caribbean, and then over her own comments about Brexit that failed to toe the government line.Rudd, 54, a close ally of Prime Minister Theresa May, was due to address lawmakers in the House of Commons on Monday to defend herself against allegations that she misled Parliament over targets for deporting illegal immigrants.Rudd’s departure strips May of a key pro-European Union voice who provided a counterpoint to pro-Brexit heavyweights, including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Environment Secretary Michael Gove. It also deprives the premier of a loyal lieutenant, who filled in for her boss in a televised election debate last year, just two days after her father died.
