Peter Thielâs Founders Fund Helps Inject $15.5 Million in Capital Into the Cryptocurrency Startup Tagomi Systems Â Â 
The Peter Thiel Founders Fund is betting that institutional investors want to get in on bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets. Thiel’s venture-capital firm maintains the biggest portfolios in Silicon Valley and just recently it made an early-stage investment in Tagomi Systems Inc. The Wall Street Journal reports that Tagomi is a startup that aims to provide electronic-trading guidance to cryptocurrency investors. Tagomi is a startup based out of New York, and the company just filed a Form D notice with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on March 15.
The report on May 1 details that the Founders Fund was involved in a funding round for Tagomi that resulted in $15.5Mn USD. The publication did not detail whether or not the Founders Fund led the seed round, and details on Tagomiâs business model is relatively unknown. However, the recently filed Form D with the SEC shows that the Founders Fund managing partner, Napoleon Ta, is named as one of Tagomiâs directors. According to reports Tagomi plans to facilitate high-speed electronic brokerage services with cryptocurrencies to institutional investors and family financial management services alongside over-the-counter (OTC) operations.

Long on Cryptocurrencies: Tagomi Systems is the Founders Fundâs Fourth Cryptocurrency Venture 
The Facebook and Paypal investor Thiel is a big believer in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Earlier this year the Founders Fund revealed it hadÂ allegedly âamassed hundreds of millions of dollarsâ of bitcoin since mid-2017. Just recently during an interview with the Economic Club of New York, Thiel stated he was âlongâ on bitcoin and called it the internetâs gold.

I would be long bitcoin, and neutral to skeptical of just about everything else at this point with a few possible exceptions â There will be one online equivalent to gold, and the one youâd bet on would be the biggest.

Tagomi Systems is not the only cryptocurrency project the Founders Fund has dipped its venture capital paws into. Thielâs fund has also recently invested in the tokenization platform Harbor. Additionally, Thielâs organization has injected capital into the funds Polychain Capital, and Metastable Capital which are primarily focused on cryptocurrency investment vehicles as well. Tagomiâs Form D filing with the SEC shows the firm has declined to disclose its revenue range, and the securities offered by the startup are disclosed as âequity.â
