 As we posted in October, the FBI closed the old site in the beginning of month and arrested its author and the owner - 29 -year-old Ross William Ulbricht, also known as "Dread Pirate Roberts". The old Silk Road worked since 2011. Because of the complexity system of registration, that ensured customers anonymity, it could not "light up” to the security services. However, the illegal goods are delivered to customers by mail in discrete packages.In addition to that, the investigators have information that in March Ulbricht ordered one of the members to make a contract killing. As information given by FBI said, the victim previously was a client who "threatened to reveal the identities of thousands of website users." In this case, the government would get the names of people who buy and sell illegal products through a special software that guarantees them complete anonymity due to the special encryption system.According to the charges against Ulbricht his website made sales of more than 9.5 million bitcoins that on the day of Ulbrich arrest was equivalent to $1.2 billion.New Silk Road has ‘wide choice’ of drugs, including ecstasy, marijuana and cocaine that are available to buy for bitcoins. It not so simple to find it ill at once, but for those who have used the previous version of Silk Road site, it is not so difficult. Moreover, some of the posts say that new Silk Road is going do develop website and is ready to hire more staff.What actions from federal regulators will be taken is not fully know yet.
