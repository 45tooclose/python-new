Ethereum Classic token will be looking to gain momentum soon in the market ahead of its new Emerald Wallet release tomorrow. This product will be one of the first decentralised applications (dApps) to launch on the Ethereum Classic Blockchain as part of the new Emerald dApp platform.
At the moment ETC is struggling to break even against BTC without its usual support from South Korean investment. According to the Ethereum Classic markets, its pairing with USDT currently accounts for over 36% of all ETC trades today; suggesting traders are favouring to  short ETC against the pegged value of tether than act on the latest news announcement just yet.
 
That being said, there are good signs on the charts that ETC could be about to make a move out of the red, with bullish indicators foreshadowing an uptrend. Let’s take a closer look.

In the 2hr ETC chart above we can see a number of promising signs appear that imply a bullish outbreak is on the cards in the next few days.   (1) Over the past two weeks the price action lows have begun to reduce along a rising uptrending support that consolidates against the upper resistance at 24,000 (0.786 fib level) - which has been unsuccessfully tested once already in the main ascending triangle pattern.
(2) Looking closer into the more recent candle activity we can see a smaller ascending triangle form with a consolidation point much closer to the announcement release tomorrow, marked by the circle on the chart.   Both of these areas will be breakout points to watch out for but wait for a continuation to hold out strong above the 24,000 Sats level before assuming the uptrend has begun.
(3) We can also see a more stronger bullish confirmation come from a convergence between the 50 and 200 EMA, with the faster moving 50 candle average climbing above the slower 200 candle average.
(4) Final confirmation of an uptrend comes from the rising Accumulation / Distribution line, which proves good market sentiment at this moment in time.

We could expect the price action to enter into a sideways channel if the opening support falls short against the stronger resistance level above.
The 25,000 Sats and 27,000 Sats (0.618 fib level) region has proven to be a tough area for Ethereum Classic token to break free from in the past, so we could see this happen again before a secondary wave of support continues the uptrend.
Diving into the current activity over 15min candles, we can see the MACD averages below the signal line but potentially starting to recover.   RSI and CCI indicators were both showing ETC as oversold briefly but now it’s back into the channel.
Although the asset still tracks well inside the ascending triangle pattern, we would like to see more bullish momentum appear on the indicators before entering into the orderbook.
Ethereum Classic (ETC) Price Prediction
A price target for the initial breakout from the ascending triangles would be at 27,000 Sats, where ETC would likely meet the strongest resistance and begin correcting. This opening run would deliver a return of 12.50%.   A second target would be just shy of the 0.5 fib level at 29,000 Sats. Delivering an overall return of 20.83% from the 24,000 Sat breakout point.   At the moment the official launch date of the Emerald Platform is still unknown. All we know from the roadmap is that we can expect it sometime this year.
