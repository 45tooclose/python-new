      Liquid Yield Option Notes, also known as  LYONs, are an instrument engineered and underwritten by Merrill Lynch. They were first created and issued in 1985 and proved to be a popular instrument with investors. LYONs are zero-coupon bonds, which means that they do not pay interest, but rather are sold at a deep discount from par, or face value.
These bonds are callable, convertible, and putable. Those three qualities combined, along with the fact that they offer no coupons, made them a financial innovation when they were created.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Liquid Yield Option Note - LYON'
      LYONs are considered a synthetic instrument. This means that they have been structured to simulate the cash flow of other financial instruments in order to meet the cash flow needs of investors.
A callable bond is one that can be called for redemption by the issuer before it matures. Issuers generally tend to redeem bonds prematurely if interest rates dip and they could save money by redeeming bonds immediately and creating a new bond issue with a new, lower interest rate. When a callable bond is redeemed before maturity, it will pay a pre-determined price based on its current maturity. Many callable bonds are also convertible bonds, like LYONs.
Convertible bonds are bonds that can be exchanged for common stock, which is stock in the company. Common stock comes with voting rights in the leadership of the company and dividend payments based on the company’s profits. When a LYON holder chooses to convert their bond to common stock, they trade their bond for a certain number of shares in the issuing company.
Investors can also take advantage of the putable aspect of LYONs. The put option for a bond allows the holder to sell their bond back to the issuer at a set date before maturity. This serves as a safeguard for the investor as a way to hedge risk in the event that they want to transfer their money to another investment.
Issuers of LYONS
Merrill Lynch engineered and served as the primary underwriter for LYONs. However, these bonds were actually issued by other corporations, not Merrill Lynch. This means that if an investor chose to convert their LYON to common stock, they would be converting it to stock shares in the company that issued the bond—not Merrill Lynch. Some of the well-known companies that issued LYONs through Merrill Lynch included Eastman Kodak, American Airlines, Motorola, and Marriott. Once a LYON has been converted to stock, the holder is entitled to all of the rights and dividends of a regular stockholder in that company.
