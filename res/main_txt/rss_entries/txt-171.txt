As the crypto and blockchain revolutions continue, the emerging ecosystem is going in interesting directions, not least European countries wanting to lead these revolutions. 
Many point to the so-called Crypto Valley based in Switzerland where many companies are clustering because of the Ethereum Foundation being based there and its reputation as a trusted financial center. 
Others that are putting their hats into the blockchain are Liechtenstein and Malta; both are trying to prove that small is beautiful and enticing crypto and blockchain companies through positive regulation. 
However, one even smaller European territory is staking a claim and that is Gibraltar, a place that has proved contentious between the UK and Spain, perhaps making it the perfect place as a bridge between two worlds; in this case financial, not political. 
 
  
Your correspondent visited there a couple of years ago, a surreal experience when walking across the border from Spain through probably the biggest car park in the world, where workers leave their vehicles before working in Gibraltar for higher wages. 
Earlier this month, however, there was the Gibfin conference that may have a huge influence on how Gibraltar may emerge as the so-called ‘Blockchain Nation’, ahead of the bigger nations trying to assume that monicker. 
 
The strategy for Gibraltar appears to be simple. Create an ecosystem where investor safety is of the utmost importance, regulation is key and led by the Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange (GBX), a subsidiary of the Gibraltar Stock Exchange. 
According to the GBX, it has already enacted Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) legislation to provide a global, and the word global is crucial, jurisdiction for crypto companies. It, effectively, wants to lead the world in what is known as RegTech.
