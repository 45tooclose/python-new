      Countermand means to cancel, revoke or reverse an order that has been previously issued. In this way it is used as a verb. As a noun, it refers to the order given that is contrary to the previous order. In the financial world, countermand is usually applicable to payments; it means a customer of a bank or financial institution revoking instructions to pay, or stopping payment to another party. It can happen when a payor stops payment on a check or stops/reverses a transfer of funds. Countermand of payment by the customer then ends the legal duty of the bank or institution to make the payment to the party, as originally specified by the customer.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Countermand'
      In finance, countermand is usually used in the context of stopping a payment. In the case of check payments, a customer can countermand the payment at any time before the check is presented, through a stop-payment order. Where electronic fund transfers are concerned, if the funds have not yet been transferred, a countermand order would cancel the original funds transfer order. If the funds have already been transferred, the financial institution would commence the process to reverse the funds transfer.
