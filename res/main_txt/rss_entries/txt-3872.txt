      Hospital revenue bond is a type of municipal bond intended to support the construction of new hospitals, nursing homes or related facilities. The bonds can also be used to purchase new equipment for these facilities, or to finance upgrades for existing hospitals. The revenue created by the hospitals is then used to repay bondholders. Generally, bondholders are paid only after the expenses of running the hospital are paid. This can create risk for bondholders if the hospital is not as profitable as anticipated.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Hospital Revenue Bond'
      Hospital revenue bonds are considered to be among the riskiest types of municipal bonds. As their name suggests, revenue bonds are generally backed by the revenue that the specific project is able to generate. If this revenue is insufficient, municipalities have no obligation to use other funds to pay back bondholders. And unlike municipalities, hospitals do not have the ability to tax residents as a way to cover expenses or repay debt.
This means that hospital revenue bonds typically command higher yields, since their default risk is greater than a general obligation bond. Ratings firms evaluate a revenue bond issue and assign a ranking indicating the probability that the obligation will be paid as scheduled. Hospitals that rely heavily on government funded programs such as Medicaid and Medicare are typically viewed as being a higher-risk investment. At the same time, uncertainty surrounding possible changes to the healthcare market and insurance laws create an even more unpredictable environment for hospitals and the bonds used to support them. Still, when there is a decrease in supply in the municipal bond market, investors are more likely to consider hospital bonds that present a higher risk.
Tax considerations for hospital revenue bonds
Income received from a hospital revenue bond may be exempt from state, local and/or federal taxation. However, this can vary by location and is impacted by current tax law, which is subject to change. A tax plan introduced by Congress in 2017 initially included a change that would prevent hospitals from issuing tax-exempt bonds, which prompted many hospitals to rush to seek funding before the proposed legislation could take effect. Several major hospital groups strongly objected to the proposed change, warning that eliminating the tax break would result in higher borrowing costs and would in turn limit or eliminate their ability to expand, renovate or build new facilitiesâ€”thus hurting communities and their residents. That proposed legislation was later dropped from the final tax plan.
