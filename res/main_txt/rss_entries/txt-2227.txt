According to the SFC, the two men breached the core principle that persons engaged in fund management business, when transacting for themselves, must give their clients priority and avoid conflicts of interest.The SFC’s investigation revealed that between January 2011 and October 2016 none of the staff members of CN Capital disclosed their personal investment holdings to CN Capital in writing. In addition, Chan and Ng conducted a total of 3,188 personal trades without obtaining any written pre-clearance from the designated officer of CN Capital.In deciding the sanctions, the SFC took into account all circumstances, including the fact that CN Capital itself reported the failures and breaches to the SFC, as well as the fact that it cooperated with the SFC in resolving the issue. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: hong kong / regulation / sfcRelated News Deutsche Bank’s Risk Systems in Question After Accidental €28b Transfer  SGX Reports Strong Financials for Q3 FY2018  OKEx Officially Denies Allegations of BTC Price Manipulation  Got a news tip?
