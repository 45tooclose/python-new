Many central banks around the world are either considering or already developing cryptocurrencies to try to meet demand brought about by the rise of Bitcoin. 
Many Bitcoin and cryptocurrency faithful have long said these would not really be in the same category as Bitcoin and other more recent cryptocurrencies as they would not be decentralised — and a paper from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, one of 12 regional Reserve Banks that make up the U.S. central bank, not only supports this argument, but goes further.  
In March the Basel-based Bank for International Settlements warned that central bankers risked endangering the stability of the global financial system if they jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon, after the likes of Sweden’s Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank revealed they've been weighing the idea. 
The Bank of England governor Mark Carney has meanwhile threatened to bring cryptocurrencies under what he described as the "regulatory tent".

The reason these central banks are keen to adopt Bitcoin-like technology is to improve existing systems of payment (and for good reason) —  but the Fed's Reserve Bank of St Louis recent paper says this misses the point of cryptocurrencies. 
The Fed's report authors, Aleksander Berentsen and Fabian Schar, write: 
 
 We predict that no reputable central bank would issue a decentralized virtual currency where users can remain anonymous. The reputational risk would simply be too high. Rather, central banks could issue central bank electronic money. This money would be tightly controlled by them. 
 
 
However, the report goes on to say: "Once we remove the decentralized nature of a cryptocurrency, not much is left of it."
