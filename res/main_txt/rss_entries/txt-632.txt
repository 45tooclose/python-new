Prices for the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization have risen during Wednesday's trading session.
According to information from crypto data site OnChainFX, the top ten currencies are all up over the past 24 hours. EOS is up by the most notable degree, having climbed 18.27% in the past day, according to market data. While it's not entirely clear what is driving the price increase, chatter around a related token airdrop has circulated in the past few days.
Other cryptocurrencies have seen more modest increases in the past day. ETH and NEO are up 4.47% and 6.4%, respectively, while cardano has risen roughly 4.1% in the past day.
By contrast, both bitcoin and bitcoin cash have experienced minor gains, climbing by about 2% and 1.7%, respectively. 

According to current market data, bitcoin has inched closer to the $7,000, trading at roughly $6,933.08 as of press time. That figure represents a roughly $100 increase from the day's open, though on Monday the cryptocurrency saw prices above $7,100 during that day's session.
As CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole wrote earlier on Wednesday, the second quarter of 2018 could bring some respite for bitcoin bulls, based on historical performance of the asset during this period in past years.
