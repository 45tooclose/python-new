      BREAKING DOWN 'Canada Premium Bond - CPB'
      Canada Premium Bond was a financial instrument that gave the Canadian government a way to manage debt, while also providing citizens with a tool for saving and investing. As with many other types of government bonds, one of the most appealing attributes of the Canada Premium Bond is that it was seen as a very safe and secure investment.
While a Canada Savings Bond is redeemable at any time, a Canada Premium Bond was redeemable once a year. It must be redeemed either on the anniversary of the issue date or within 30 days of it. Once a CPB has reached maturity, it no longer earns any additional interest. If a CPB is redeemed before it reaches maturity, the redeemer will receive the face value plus all interest earned as of the last anniversary of the issue date.
History of Canada Premium Bonds
Canada Premium Bonds were part of the Canada Savings Bonds program that was created in 1946. Originally, the program offered just Canada Savings Bonds. The bonds were introduced as part of the countryâ€™s postwar financing program. The program reached its peak in the late 1980s, at one point recording $55 billion of outstanding retail debt. Canada Premium Bonds were introduced as an addition to this program in 1998.
Eventually, the arrival of other investing options in a competitive market, coupled with escalating administrative costs, made the CSB program increasingly less cost-effective and profitable for the government. The Canadian government ended the program as part of its 2017 federal budget, with sales of the bonds ending in November 2017. The government said dwindling sales of the bonds and rising costs involved with managing the program did not make it financially worthwhile to keep the program going. Existing bonds will continue to earn interest until they are redeemed or reach the point of maturity. Unmatured bonds that were lost or stolen can be reissued. Government officials did not recommend specific investing alternatives, but advised the public to consult with their financial advisors to discuss options that would be the best fit for their individual circumstances and financial goals.
