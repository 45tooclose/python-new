      The internal capital generation rate (ICGR) is a quantifiable mathematical rate that portrays how quickly a bank is able to generate equity capital. The internal capital generation rate is calculated by dividing the bank's retained earnings by the average balance of the combined equity of all stockholders for a given accounting period. The bank's retained earnings are found by subtracting dividends paid from net income.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Internal Capital Generation Rate - ICGR'
      The higher the internal capital generation rate, the more able a bank is to produce capital to loan. This rate improves with a bank's profitability and is also affected by the price of its stock. A quick way to calculate the internal capital generation rate is to take the plowback ratio and multiply by the return on equity (ROE). The plowback ratio is what is left over after dividends have been paid out of retained earnings.
Example Internal Capital Generation Rate Calculation
For example, if the plowback ratio is 0.80 and return on equity is 17%, the internal capital generation rate is 13.6%. Thus, the company grew its capital equity by 13.6%.
