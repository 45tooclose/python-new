            President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, asked a federal judge in Manhattan to give his lawyers the right to first review the documents seized by the FBI in a search of his office, home and hotel room so they can see if any information was covered by attorney-client privilege.The Friday hearing was to review Cohen’s request for a temporary restraining order to stop prosecutors from reviewing the documents seized during the searches. It was quickly adjourned to Monday after another lawyer for Trump interjected that she needed more time to prepare. Attorneys for the government said they would wait to review the materials until then.Joanna Hendon said that as Cohen’s client, Trump has the right to assert what’s privileged, not Cohen. “He has an acute interest in those proceedings and the manner in which these materials are reviewed,” Hendon told the court. Her firm, Spears & Imes LLP, was retained on April 11 and she said she’d had just two hours notice of the arguments.

        It’s unclear precisely what prosecutors were pursuing in the searches, but they sought information about several embarrassing episodes in Trump’s private life that endangered his candidacy and now could imperil his presidency, according to the New York Times. They include a $130,000 payment Cohen said he made to a porn star who claimed to have had sex with Trump, another payment to a Playboy playmate, and the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape in which Trump bragged about grabbing women’s genitals. Agents also sought records on Cohen’s taxi business, CNN reported.
