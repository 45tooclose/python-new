            President Donald Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani said hush money paid to a porn actress during the 2016 election didn’t violate campaign finance laws, seeking to clarify comments he made earlier in the week.“There is no campaign violation,” Giuliani said in a statement on Friday. “The payment was made to resolve a personal and false allegation in order to protect the President’s family. It would have been done in any event, whether he was a candidate or not.”#lazy-img-327383604:before{padding-top:66.66666666666666%;}Rudy GiulianiPhotographer: Victor J. Blue/BloombergHe issued the statement a day after comments that critics said bolstered the case that a $130,000 payment Trump’s long-time personal attorney, Michael Cohen, made to porn star Stormy Daniels in October 2016 violated campaign finance laws.

        Giuliani indicated on Fox News’s “Fox and Friends” Thursday morning that the hush money was related to the election. Cohen paid Daniels the money to stay silent about an affair she allegedly had with Trump more than a decade ago.

        “Imagine if that came out on October 15, 2016 in the middle of the, you know, last debate with Hillary Clinton,” Giuliani, a former New York mayor, said on the show. “Cohen didn’t even ask. Cohen made it go away. He did his job.”Giuliani also said that comments he made about “timing” were based on his own understanding of events rather than the president’s knowledge.Giuliani told the Washington Post on Wednesday that Trump was paying Cohen a retainer of $35,000 per month even though Cohen was doing no legal work. The total, about $460,000, was used to reimburse the Daniels payment and cover other things, he said.Such an arrangement would appear to be a liability that would normally be reported on a federal financial disclosure report by a new president. Trump didn’t disclose such a debt.
