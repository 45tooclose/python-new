      The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, or MSRB, is a regulating body that creates rules and policies for investment firms and banks in the issuing and sale of municipal bonds, notes and other municipal securities by states, cities and counties. Activities regulated by the MSRB include the underwriting, trading and selling of municipal securities financing public projects. The MSRB is a self-regulating organization managed by a Board of Directors, with four committees that oversee specific aspects of the organization’s governance and operation. Like the New York Stock Exchange or the National Association of Securities Dealers, the MSRB is a self-regulatory organization that is subject to supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board - MSRB'
      The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board was created by the U.S. Congress in 1975. It was given the assignment of creating rules and policies that would help prevent fraud and misleading acts in the securities industry. The MSRB was also designed to implement and support fair trading principles. In addition, it was tasked with creating and maintaining a system that would allow free and open trade in the securities market. One of its first accomplishments was creating a set of uniform standards dictating fair practices that municipal securities dealers should follow. The organization was also instrumental in paving the way for a smooth transition from traditional paper bonds to electronic versions in the 1980s.  
The MSRB’s role in promoting continuing Disclosure
In the 1980s, the MSRB played a central role in assisting the SEC in creating SEC Rule 15c2-12, which focuses on continuing disclosure. This ensures that issuers of municipal securities must agree to provide certain information to the MSRB on a regular basis about the securities they handle. This information includes annual financial reports and notices about events such as delinquencies, defaults, unscheduled draws on debt service reserves and any events that would affect the tax-exempt status of the security.
This rule and related principles involving disclosures were prompted by an incident in 1983 in which the Washington Public Power Supply System defaulted on more than $2 billion in municipal bonds, representing one of the biggest and most costly municipal bond disasters in U.S. history.
More recently, the MSRB has served a role as a pioneer in helping to usher in the age of open electronic records in the securities industry. In the late 2000s, MSRB launched the Electronic Municipal Market Access website, which provides free public access to information related to municipal bond trading, along with important disclosure documents.
