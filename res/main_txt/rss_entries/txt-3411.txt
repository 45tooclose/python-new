      BREAKING DOWN 'SPARQS'
      Stock participation accreting redemption quarterly-pay securities (SPARQS) is a note issued at a set price with interest paid quarterly. The issuer can call the notes after a specified period. When called, the holders are paid out a specified amount that includes all of the future interest payments. This calling is done when the price of the stock has risen rapidly. If, on the other hand, the notes reach maturity, the holders receive a specified amount of shares in the underlying company. SPARQS serve as a low-risk way to expose an investor to the stock market.
Similar to a callable bond or redeemable bond, the SPARQS is unique in that it is specific to Morgan Stanley. A callable bond is a bond which can be redeemed by the issuer before its maturity. 
If interest rates have declined since the company first issued the bond, the company is likely to want to refinance this debt at the lower rate of interest. In this case, the company "calls" its current bonds and reissues them at a lower interest rate. A callable bond is a debt instrument in which the issuer reserves the right to return the investor's principal and stop interest payments before the bond's maturity date. A bond maturing in 2030 can be called in 2020, whereas a SPARQS can be called much earlier, and is often associated with shorter term debts.
Background Information on Morgan Stanley
Morgan Stanley is a financial services company headquartered in New York City and founded in 1935 as a result of the Glass–Steagall Act. The Glass-Steagall Act separated commercial and investment banking in 1933. While it was initially a part of J.P. Morgan & Co. after the legislation was passed the company chose commercial banking and Henry S. Morgan and Harold Stanley left the corporation to found what is now Morgan Stanley.
Long considered a rival of Goldman Sachs, the bank has a reputation as the more conservative and cautious of the two. Today, Morgan Stanley offers both investment bank and financial services and operates mainly in institutional securities, wealth management, and investment management, providing services to corporations, governments, large private financial institutions and high-net-worth individuals. Though considered rather conservative, Morgan Stanley is also known for its riskier, high-growth sector of technology. Morgan Stanley was the lead underwriter for offerings of Google, Inc., Groupon, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., and Salesforce.com. It was also instrumental in IPOs for Apple, Inc. and Facebook, Inc. Morgan Stanley was also the lead underwriter for Snap Inc.'s IPO, which raised $3.4 billion earlier this year.
In 2011 and 2012 Morgan Stanley made wide, sweeping changes to its business model. Reducing their fixed-income activities and adding employees to its equities trading unit, Morgan Stanley focused their business on wealth management rather than derivatives to fit a new, lower-beta revenue model for the modern financial era, abiding by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act’s more stringent rules.
