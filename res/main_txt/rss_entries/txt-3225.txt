      BREAKING DOWN 'Europe, Australasia, Far East - EAFE'
      Europe, Australasia and the Far East represents some of the most productive and profitable regions in the world. Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) created a stock market index known as the MSCI EAFE to capture the performance of large- and mid-capitalization companies in the EAFE region. The MSCI EAFE index covers approximately 85% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization of each of the countries included in the index.

MSCI tracks the equity performance of more than 900 companies across 21 countries in Europe, Australasia and the Far East. As for Europe, the countries included in the index as of May 2016 are: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

Beyond the various funds available to investors based on this index, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), NYSE Liffe US and the Bclear platform of Liffe are licensed to list futures contracts on the MSCI EAFE.
In addition to the MSCI EAFE index, MSCI has the MSCI EAFE IMI index and the MSCI EAFE All Cap Index. The EAFE IMI index tracks the performance of large-, mid-, and small-capitalization companies.
