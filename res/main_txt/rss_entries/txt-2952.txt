IBM’s Newest Blockchain Project Tracks Jewelry Sourcing
IBM established a blockchain-based consortium with companies involved in every step of the jewelry supply chain to make tracking easier for both customers and intermediary purchasers.

  Ethical jewelry is a concept that’s been around for a long time, but there’s been no truly reliable way to track it until immutable and ever-robust blockchains came along. A new alliance forged between IBM, Helzberg, and several companies along the jewelry supply chain called TrustChain aims to help bring this blockchain dream to reality.

“What we are announcing and bringing forward has been in the works for some time. It’s the first end-to-end industry capability on blockchain that has its core in trust,” said Jason Kelley, IBM’s blockchain general manager, speaking to TechCrunch.

Currently, customers have to trust that their jewelry was mined and forged ethically. They usually have no idea which companies were involved in the middle of the process, and thus purchase an end product that doesn’t tell its story entirely. Only bits and pieces can be sourced using current methods.
TrustChain was formed with the hope that it can elaborate the journey that the jewelry took from the mining company to the dealer floor without missing a step along the way. However tempting it is to superimpose a blockchain onto a problem and calling it solved, but what does IBM’s technology do when jewelry dealers attempt to disrupt it?

“If there is a dispute, instead of calling and following back through the process in a more manual way, you can click on a trusted chain and you’re able to see what happened immediately. That reduces the number of steps in the process, and speeds up what has been a paper-laden and manual effort. Now we can share this [data] in a permissioned network and we can be sure it’s accurate,” Kelley said.

Although TrustChain certainly minimizes the burden involved in tracking jewelry, it will only be able to prove itself once it’s put into practice. IBM already has experience with this, though, since it’s already provided blockchain technology to more than 400 companies.
