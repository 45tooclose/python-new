The tweet asked users to send 0.005 BTC to an address to enter, with the winner to be announced on May 3. This is an all too common crypto-scam on Twitter, with fake accounts impersonating major players in the space announcing fake ETH giveaways with dozens of replies saying it worked. What makes this scam different, however, is that this is the first time hackers managed to take control of a legitimate account in order to perpetrate the scam.Hey, everyone! Vertcoin and staff are pleased to announce that we’re doing a 10 BTC giveaway to our followers to celebrate Vertcoin's success. Send 0.005 to 3HU5sj7kB6wT9zRwpbhCRrR28vKWjfkMKf enter!
