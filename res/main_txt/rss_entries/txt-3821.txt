      An accumulation bond is a bond sold at a discount, known as an original issue discount, and on which the bond issuer is not required to make semi-annual interest payments, as is typically done. In other words, the bondholder, or lender, is simply giving the company that issued the bond less money than it has legally borrowed, and in exchange will forgo the interest income. An accumulation bond is so named because the value of the bond accumulates over time. They are also known as zero-coupon discount bonds.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Accumulation Bond'
      As accumulation bonds are always sold at an original issue discount, they are always sold below face value, and the Internal Revenue Service considers the OID a form of interest. Even though the bondholder is not receiving coupon payments, the interest on the bond is still accumulating and must be reported as interest income on the bondholder's tax return each year. This is sometimes referred to as phantom income.
Some investors like to use accumulation bonds in their financial plans, as they know the exact amount they will receive at a future point in time when the bond matures, even though they don't receive interim cash flows. Investors in accumulation bonds should be aware, however, that accumulation bonds are at risk of suffering steep price declines during times of rising interest rates.
Accumulation bonds are most often issued by federal, local, or state government agencies.
Example of an Accumulation Bond
The Widget Group needs to build a new widget factory, and also needs some extra money to refurbish its offices. The factory will cost $710,000, while the refurbishment will cost $33,000. The executives of the The Widget Group decide to sell an accumulation bond to finance these expenditures, promising to repay its lenders to $1 million in 15 years. But because this is an accumulation bond, The Widget Group will pay no interest on the loan. Instead, it will not receive the entire $1 million up front, but a discounted $743,000, enough to meet its new expenses. The difference of $257,000 that the lender did not have to lend makes up for the lack of interest income. In this hypothetical example, the bond’s interest rate would amount to approximately 2%.
The bondholder, however, would not recognize this income all at once, either at the beginning or the end of the bond’s maturity. That’s because of the IRS’s treatment of this income as being accumulated over time.
