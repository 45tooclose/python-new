Reaching lows of under $6,500 in Q1 this year, BTC/USD gained over 30% in April and has continued climbing since, reaching $9,750 for the first time since March 8th this week.At press time, slight volatility was visible on markets, with swings of several hundred dollars occurring on hourly charts.A Familiar TrendWhile Bitcoinist previously reported on research showing long-term trends pointing at the start of a ‘hodl’ period in Bitcoin, this week saw one of the clearest signs yet that a trading spree could soon begin.Goldman Sachs, the investment bank whose CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in December last year that Bitcoin “isn’t for him,” revealed to the New York Times it plans to offer Bitcoin futures trading within weeks.Afterward, an executive said that more direct buying and selling could roll out to clients who have “inundated” the bank with Bitcoin access requests. The move echoes that of CME Group and CBOE, both of which released licensed Bitcoin futures in mid-December, at a time when prices were propelled to over $20,000 on some exchanges. On social media, commentators were debating the likelihood of history repeating itself when Goldman clients enter the market. As with the first round of Bitcoin futures, which subsequently produced lackluster performance in the bear market, Goldman’s performance will also be watched closely.What do you think about Charlie Shrem’s Bitcoin price prediction?
