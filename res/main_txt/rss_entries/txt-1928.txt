 Bitmarkers CEO and Co-Founder, Ardon Lukasiewicz plans to offer frictionless movement for gambling money via the use of bitcoin. “I’d like to pursue Las Vegas as the bitcoin mega-destination,” he says. Online gambling usually is uncontrolled by government and other regulators. But real-world casinos were always under special oversight of regulatory commissions that focus their attention on preventing money laundering and tax evasion. Some people often try to “clean” illegitimate cash money by circulating them in casinos that is why casino control level is continuously developing.In January this year the Wall Street Journal reported that “Casino operator Las Vegas Sands (LVS) will no longer allow gamblers to transfer funds from their bank accounts using an alias because of increasing compliance procedures coming from gambling regulators”. “There are more international funds moving around and more stress about where the money comes from and where it’s going,” said Michael Leven, president of Las Vegas Sands. However, Lukasiewicz has already got a list of gamblers interested in his company’s services. Bitmakers develop a model of casino hotel bookings with bitcoin.Company has a clear vision of how online and in person at a real casino gambling differ, and they understand how important it is to give personal attention to each player. “It isn’t a high volume ‘grind’ such as other bitcoin gaming options,” said Lukasiewicz. “We are building the platform to be easier, cheaper, and more private than a regular player’s current options while also simplifying things to be more welcoming to newcomers,” he said.Image source: www.flickr.com
