      A retail repurchase agreement is an alternative to traditional savings deposit. Under a bank-issued retail repurchase agreement, an investor buys a pool of securities, usually U.S. government or agency debt, for a term of less than 90 days, after which the bank repurchases that pool of securities at a premium. The extra income earned from the transaction is analogous to the interest an investor would earn from a traditional savings deposit, while the pool of securities represents collateral that insures future repayment. A retail repurchase agreement is sold in small denominations of $1,000 or less, in contrast to a wholesale repurchase agreement, which are sold to large investors and institutions in denominations of $1 million or more.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Retail Repurchase Agreement'
      The retail repurchase agreement market, and repo markets in general, developed in the 1970s and 1980s as a means for securities firms and banks to raise short-term capital during an era of steadily rising interest rates. The repo market has grown to become an integral part of the U.S. financial system’s plumbing, as a place where large financial institutions with big holdings of safe government bonds can use those assets as collateral to meet their short-term financing needs.
In 1979, U.S. banking regulators exempted retail repurchase agreements from interest-rate caps, and in 1981 banks and savings and loan institutions began offering these investments to retail investors at premium rates in an attempt to compete with money market mutual funds for depositors. By September of 1981, the total amount of retail repos outstanding was $13.3 billion.
Risks of Retail Repurchase Agreements
In this environment of quickly rising interest rates, retail repurchase agreements were a convenient way for retail investors to earn higher returns on investments, which were still relatively liquid and safe. But unlike traditional deposits, retail repurchase agreements are not protected by deposit insurance. And while retail repo agreements are typically backed by very safe government debt, investors claim on that collateral is not always clear. Investors in retail repurchase agreements should therefore always trust the soundness of the issuing financial institutions.
Retail Repurchase Agreements vs. Money Market Funds
A popular alternative to retail repurchase agreements are money market funds, which allow investors to invest in government securities, tax-exempt municipal securities, or corporate debt securities on a short term basis. The total size of the money market fund industry has grown to more than $2.8 trillion in 2017, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
