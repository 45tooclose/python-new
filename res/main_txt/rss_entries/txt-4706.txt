      A Tier I spill is one of the three categorized levels of oil spills. Tier 1 spills are the least serious, causing localized damage usually within or near the company's own facilities. In most cases, this type of spill occurs as a result of the company's own activities.
Tier 1 spills are typically able to be cleaned up and resolved within a few days, or sometimes in only a matter of hours. The International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association, or IPIECA, has defined the three tiers of spills according to various characteristics.
All companies operating within the petroleum industry have prevention and preparedness measures in place for oil spills. However, even excellent prevention measures can sometimes fail, due to weather, geologic activity, or failure on the part of personnel. Therefore, companies make a point to prepare for a quick response in the event of an oil spill. Failure to respond efficiently could turn a manageable Tier 1 spill into a Tier 2, or even Tier 3 event.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Tier 1 Spill'
      Tier 1 spills are generally the responsibility of the operating company to clean up. Therefore, a company should have a specialized spill management team. The training for this team focuses on response management skills, safety, site-specific cleanup techniques, and tactical operations specific to the type of site they are operating within. However, according to Interspill, sometimes spills that are classified as Tier 1 are so minor as to simply require the use of “a modest stock of absorbent materials which are used to mop up occasional spills that occur.”
Tier 1 spills can happen with some frequency, which is why an internal team is necessary in order to rectify any spill immediately. Once external help is required, the spill generally becomes classified as a Tier 2 spill. However, in the event that a company is operating in a remote location, their spill management team should be equipped with Tier 2 skills and capabilities, since the cost and wait time of bringing in external help may be prohibitive in the moment that a spill occurs.
Springing into action for a Tier 1 spill
In many situations, particularly in marine terminals, being part of a Tier 1 spill response team is not a full-time role. Rather, a full-time employee with another role will also be trained in Tier 1 spill response. If a spill occurs, that person, along with other trained team members, temporarily leaves their usual post and assists with the spill cleanup. Once the spill has been remedied, they return to their usual posts.
