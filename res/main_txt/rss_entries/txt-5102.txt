      A silver parachute is a clause in a hiring contract that outlines special compensation arrangements paid to certain employees when they leave a company or their position has been made redundant, especially following a merger, acquisition or other change in corporate control. Silver parachutes may include severance pay in the form of cash, a special bonus, stock options or vesting of previously awarded compensation. The contract includes explicit language detailing the conditions under which the sliver parachute clause will go into effect.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Silver Parachute'
      A silver parachute is similar to the more widely known golden parachute, which often applies to the top executives in an organization. A silver parachute is typically smaller than a golden parachute, with more employees eligible to receive them. Golden and silver parachutes are named as such because they are intended to provide a soft landing for employees of certain levels who lose their jobs. 
Typically, some type of tin parachute goes into effect for all other employees made redundant within three years of a change of corporate control. When enacted, employees are often eligible to receive one year’s salary plus two weeks for each year’s service up to 52 weeks.
Parachute clause examples
The 2008 financial crisis brought parachute clauses into the spotlight. They drew scrutiny as the top executives of some of the nation’s largest banks and brokerages received of millions dollars in severance while their companies relied on taxpayer bailout and takeovers. 
One of the more famous examples of a golden parachute was the approximately $160 million severance payment Stan O’Neal received from Merrill Lynch. The ousted chairman and chief executive received his payment in October of 2007 as the scope of the financial crisis started to come into view. 
In addition to monetary awards, other examples of opulent parachute benefits include continued enrollment in pension plans or the vesting of all retirement benefits, health and dental insurance, and the payment of legal fees, which received criticism from shareholders and the public. As a result, the post-financial crisis era has seen many companies review their executive-level compensation policies and devise new ways to link performance to corporate success.
In many cases, their goal has been to determine whether such packages were in the best interests of the firm and its investors. Potentially at odds with that sentiment is that one of the arguments in favor of parachute clauses is that they encourage executives to continue to innovate and take on risk to grow their organization.
