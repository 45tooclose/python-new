Noyce and Moore left Fairchild Semiconductor to launch a new venture, NM Electronics. Several months later, they purchased the rights for the name Integrated Electronics Corporation from a company called Intelco. In 1969, they developed the Intel logo, with the e dropped below the other letters. Later that year, Intel introduced its first product, the 3101 random access memory (RAM) chip.
In 1974, Intel Corp. (INTC) introduced the first, general-purpose microprocessor, the 8080. Intel began marketing its famous 8086 microprocessor in 1978.
