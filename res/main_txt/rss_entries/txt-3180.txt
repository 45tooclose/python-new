Bitfinex, a major cryptocurrency exchange, also recently banned the petro.The opposition-controlled Legislature in Venezuela has described the cryptocurrency as being “illegal and unconstitutional.” Nevertheless, the government has continued with its plans for the cryptocurrency, even declaring it to a legal tender in the country.Venezuela has been suffering from hyperinflation, an extremely devalued national currency, as well as economic sanctions.
