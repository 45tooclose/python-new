      The term double exempt refers to a type of tax benefit attached to certain bonds that allows the interest earned from the bonds exempt from being taxed as gross income from both federally and by state taxation. For example, municipal bonds, also called munis, are usually exempt from federal taxes and in some states where they are issued, also exempt from state taxes too.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Double Exempt'
      Abond’s taxation status as double exempt, in reference to municipal bonds, refers to the fact that interest on those bonds is not subject to taxation at either the federal or state level. In general, most states do not tax residents on interest income arising from tax-exempt bonds issued by that state, its agencies, its cities or other political entities. However, virtually all states tax individuals on interest from bonds issued out-of-state, although those bonds remain exempt from federal taxes. In other words, buying bonds issued by the state you live in can give you the benefit of double exempt.
Municipal bonds, including those for which the interest is not taxable at the state or local level, are attractive to taxpayers who wish to minimize or avoid taxes on their interest income. These securities often pay a commensurately lower interest rate than taxable issues such as corporate bonds, although depending on one's tax bracket and comparative yields, they may sometimes yield more on an after-tax basis. Double exempt bond income can be an AMT preference item in some cases. 
From a tax perspective, this treatment often makes bonds issued in one's home state more attractive than those issued out-of-state. And to sweeten the pot, some interest from municipal securities is also exempt from local income tax in jurisdictions where such taxes apply, technically making them triple tax-exempt.
Limitations on double exempt
Although  double exempt bonds sound like they are exempt from all tax, there are some limitations. In some cases, for example, interest earned on the bonds will be subject to an alternative minimum tax, which is essentially a different form of federal taxation specifically targeted towards private acuity bonds.
And of course, not all municipal bonds are automatically exempt from federal, state, or local taxes, so check before you buy or invest. Also, be warned: some experts caution against investing too heavily in home-state bonds simply for the lure of the double exempt taxation status.
