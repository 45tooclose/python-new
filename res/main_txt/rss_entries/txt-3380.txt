Earlier this year, the Rungsted Seier Capital ice rink in Denmark was rebranded to Bitcoin Arena by co-owner Lars Seier Christensen and billionaire sponsor Niklas Nikolajsen. 
The two individuals that oversee the operations of the stadium said that they were keen on rebranding it to spread awareness of bitcoin. Nikolajsen emphasized that he and his partner were intrigued by the attention the stadium’s rebranding would bring to the cryptocurrency market and bitcoin, especially in a country like Denmark whose blockchain sector has not evolved relative to other regions. 
“It shows how far bitcoin has really come. It is quite interesting that when the classic banks move out, we move in.” And I’m going to pull on a smile when I hear the sports commentators, every time they switch over to a match in Rungsted, they have to switch to the Bitcoin Arena. It’s funny, and it’s clear that it’s a little nasty thin,” siad Nikolajsen. 
As a part of the initiative, the stadium also secured a partnership with Bitcoin Suisse AG, a regulated crypto financial broker, asset manager and service provider based in Zug, Switzerland, that has been serving some of the biggest initial coin offerings (ICOs), cryptocurrency companies, and businesses over the past few years. 
According to a Danish media outlet, Nikolajsen, who is known as an early-stage cryptocurrency investor and a bitcoin billionaire, also is the co-founder of Bitcoin Suisse AG and has since processed the salaries of hockey players in bitcoin. At the time, Nikolaj Rosenthal was the only hockey player to be paid in bitcoin by Bitcoin Suisse. 
“I can imagine that they would. It’s really exciting to be allowed to be a pioneer with this,” he said at the time.
Slovenia Bitcoin Monument
In March, Slovenia-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp, which remains as one of the leading trading platforms in the global cryptocurrency market since 2011, created a bitcoin monument and placed in one of the main highway intersections of the country.

Both projects, the rebranding of the Danish stadium to Bitcoin Arena and the establishment of a bitcoin monument in the center of Slovenia were led by two of the leading companies in the cryptocurrency sector, one from the cryptocurrency exchange market and the other from the brokerage industry. 
Companies in South Korea and Japan are running similar initiatives as placing ads on the main billboards of city centers and promoting various cryptocurrencies in innovative ways to increase the adoption of the market in general.
This week, on the Joe Rogan podcast, it was revealed that one of the largest Karate competitions has received bitcoin sponsorships by various bitcoin companies and in the middle of the cage, the producers placed a giant bitcoin logo to promote the cryptocurrency.
