            President Donald Trump repaid his lawyer Michael Cohen for a $130,000 hush payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign, Rudy Giuliani said, contradicting previous statements by the president."Funneled it through the law firm, and then the president repaid it,’’ Giuliani, who serves on Trump’s legal team, said Wednesday during an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News.#lazy-img-327355815:before{padding-top:66.68334167083543%;}Stormy DanielsPhotographer: Victor J. Blue/BloombergCohen, Trump’s personal attorney, is in the midst of a legal firestorm over the payment to Daniels, which was made during the 2016 presidential campaign in exchange for Daniels’ silence about an alleged affair with Trump.

        “When I heard Cohen’s retainer of $35,000, when he was doing no work for the president, I said ‘That’s how he’s repaying, with a little profit and a little margin for paying taxes for Michael’,’’ Giuliani said.

        “He didn’t know about the specifics of it, as far as I know,’’ he said. “But he did know about the general arrangement, that Michael would take care of things like this.’’“That money was not campaign money, sorry," Giuliani added.
