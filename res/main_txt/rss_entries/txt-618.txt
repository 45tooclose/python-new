 Crypto exchange Bittrex, the 7th largest worldwide by trading volume as of press time, has reopened its registration portal for new user accounts, the company announced April 10. In December 2017, the exchange was forced to start temporarily turning away new users, due to a massive influx of signup requests.Not everyone in the crypto sphere is celebrating however. The vast majority of tweets responding to Bittrex’s stirring declaration — “The.Wait.Is.Over” — were disgruntled by the new interface, with one user decrying it as “merely an exercise in CSS prettiness,” and another:Where is the buy price, bid price, last price and 24hr high and low. ð¤¦ð»‍âï¸ð¤¦ð»‍âï¸ð¤¦ð»‍âï¸ð¤¦ð»‍âï¸ð¤¦ð»‍âï¸ you have one job.
