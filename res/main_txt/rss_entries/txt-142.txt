A recent report claims it might be.  
Per an article today in by Omkar Godbole in Coindesk, Bitcoin may finally be reaching the bottom of its bear run. 
To cryptocurrency enthusiasts, this might come as a welcome hypothesis—with Bitcoin hitting a 50-day low today at $6,630 USD—though Godbole indicates that it's probably going to get worse before it gets better, speculating that BTC will fall in the $6,600-$6,000 range over the weekend. 
[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.] 
The evidence from market analysis? According to Godbole: 
 
  
 
 BTC tends to reverse course every time the relative strength index (RSI) drops to or below 30.00, according to historical data.... As of writing, the relative strength index is close to that mark, at 32.00.

This report also follows a recent tweet from Digital Currency Group Founder Barry Silbert, in which he indicated that part of the renewed bear cycle stems from a sell-off related to tax season.

    Is the BTC sell-off due to the incoming tax deadline? 
    
   
  
 
That said, if the market sees a drop below $6,000 that holds, it is likely a signal of a deeper sell-off.
