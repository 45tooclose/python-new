Techcrunch said Earn was sold in a deal worth more than $120 ‎million including the total value of cash, cryptocurrency, stock and management earn-outs. ‎Earn has already raised the same value over multiple funding rounds ‎since its founding nearly five years ago. ‎Founded in 2013, Earn originally was developing chips and hardware for ‎cryptocurrency ‎mining. The startup had rebranded in 2017 from 21.co with the launch of its ‎eponymous paid messaging platform, which allows senders to pay users in cryptocurrency to reply ‎to emails and complete tasks.‎It has since pivoted to crypto-based ‎messaging technology, which ‎some believe the ultimate goal was to decentralize its network allowing each person to ‎join the ‎project and earn digital currencies for their micro tasks.‎ Brian Armstrong, Co-Founder and CEO at Coinbase, said:” We’re going to be doubling down on the Earn ‎business within Coinbase, as they have built a paid email ‎product that is arguably one of the earliest practical ‎blockchain applications to achieve meaningful traction.”‎Commenting on the new CTO appointment, he added: “As CTO of Coinbase, Balaji will serve an important role as ‎the technological evangelist for the company. Balaji will ‎evangelize for both crypto and for Coinbase, educating the ‎world and recruiting crypto-first talent to the company.‎”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('inside_article_MPU'); }); Share this article Tags: Acquisition / coinbase / crypto exchangesRelated News Cloud Mining Put to the Test- Is It Worth Your Money?
