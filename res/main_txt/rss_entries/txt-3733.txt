      A closed-end indenture is a term in a bond contract that guarantees that the collateral used to back the bond issue cannot be used again to back another bond issue. This is the opposite of an open-end indenture in which more than one bond can be backed by a single collateral. A closed-end indenture makes the bond, an already low-risk investment, even less risky for the investor. The type of indenture of a bond affects risk but is otherwise only invoked if the issuer defaults on the bond. Therefore, this term is more important the less stable an issuer is.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Closed-End Indenture'
      A closed-end indenture is one small but crucial detail in the terms of a bond that affects the risk of the bond for both issuer and investor. All bonds have contracts, called indentures, outlining the terms of the bond. Indentures are legally binding and unconditional, and the penalty for breaking them is severe. The yield-to-maturity rate is not listed in the conditions of the bond because it is assumed to be the market interest rate. Terms listed in the indenture include face value of the bond, interest rate or coupon rate, interest payment dates, maturity date, name of the trustee that administers the bond including paying interest payments, terms for paying off the bond at maturity or early and the collateral that will be given to the investor if the issuer defaults on the bond. This last term specifying the collateral is either an open-end indenture or a closed-end indenture.
Closed-End Indenture and Stability of the Bond Issuer
Closed-end or open-end indentures are only invoked if the bond issuer defaults, which means that this term is only important in a situation of financial instability for the bond issuer. If the bond issuer defaults, a closed-end indenture ensures the bondholders will have the only claims on the collateral, making their bonds the most senior security. The fewer claims that exist on the collateral, the more safety a bondholder has. An open-end indenture bond could have any number of bonds with the same collateral used to back up the security, so in the event of a default, an investor might have no possibility to claim that collateral if another investor has a senior claim on the collateral.
A less stable bond issuer has more incentive to include an open-end indenture term in the bond indenture, because a stable issuer has more confidence that they will not default and can therefore include a closed-end indenture in the terms of the bond they issue. This means that the type of indenture can be used by the investor along with interest rate and time to maturity to assess risk and make a decision about investing in a specific bond issue.
