      Tertiary recovery is also known as enhanced oil recovery, or EOR. EOR is the third phase of oil extraction from an oil reserve. This phase of oil extraction allows petroleum companies to remove a significant amount of oil from a reserve that they would not be able to access without these enhanced methods.
Oil extraction from a site begins with primary recovery, during which  a combination of pressure and pumps generally will bring about 10 percent of the available oil to the surface. The second phase of recovery involves injecting water or gas into the reserve to displace even more of the oil reserve, usually 20 to 40 percent. Finally, tertiary recovery can be used to recover any remaining oil that may be accessible.

      BREAKING DOWN 'Tertiary Recovery'
      Tertiary recovery is generally accomplished in one of three ways. The first is thermal recovery. In thermal recovery, the reservoir is heated, often with the introduction of steam. This warms the oil, thinning it so that it loses some of its viscosity and is more apt to flow.
The second method is through gas injection. In gas injection, gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or natural gas are pumped into the reservoir, where they then expand. Once they expand, the pressure pushes the remaining oil through the reservoir.
The third method of tertiary recovery is chemical injection. Chemical injection involves injecting polymers, which are long-chained molecules into the reservoir in order to lower surface tension and allow the oil to flow more freely. This method is used significantly less frequently than thermal recovery or gas injection. Less than one percent of tertiary recovery in the U.S. is accomplished through chemical injection.
Carbon dioxide injection on the rise
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the use of carbon dioxide in EOR, often written CO₂-EOR has large potential. In the past, the carbon dioxide used for this type of recovery came from naturally occurring carbon dioxide reserves. However, today, it is possible to harvest carbon dioxide from natural gas processors, and fertilizer and ethanol producers. That carbon dioxide can then be transported by pipeline to an injection site. One site in Canada hopes to extend a field’s life by up to 25 years through the use of CO₂-EOR.
The decision of whether to use CO₂-EOR  on a site largely depends on the site’s geography and geology. It can be a very costly process and though it may extend the life of the oil field, it can sometimes be too costly for a producer to consider it a worthy investment. The cost of oil is driven by a combination of global demand and global production. When deciding whether or not to undertake this type of tertiary recovery, a producer will look at current and projected oil prices to determine the action’s worth.
