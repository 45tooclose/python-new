        To read about another prospective Saudi investment in the U.S., click hereSaudi Arabia is increasing chemical production with demand for motor fuels expected to slow amid tightening fuel efficiency standards and the rise of electric vehicles. Fracking and horizontal drilling in shale formations have unleashed torrents of cheap U.S. natural gas that made the country among the most profitable places to produce chemicals, beating the Middle East in attracting projects.Plastics PlantsDowDuPont Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp., and Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. are putting the finishing touches on multibillion-dollar factories along the Texas Gulf Coast, part of $188 billion in proposed and recently completed project, according to the American Chemistry Council.Almost 20 factories are being built or expanded to convert gas liquids such as ethane and propane into ethylene, the most used petrochemical and the main ingredient in polyethylene plastic.Most of the investment is coming from abroad. South Africa’s Sasol Ltd. is spending $11 billion on a chemical complex outside Lake Charles, Louisiana.
