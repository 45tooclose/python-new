HighlightsApril continues to amaze but after an impressive rally, Bitcoin and other majors showed signs of bearish exhaustion as the market became overbought after topping out at $9,767 today.Daily ChartAs predicted BTC met stiff resistance near the 200-day MA ($9800) and while today’s pullback is mildly disconcerting, the longterm set up for BTC remains positive. 4 HR ChartThe underlying bullish trend remains intact as BTC continues to trade above the descending channel and the 50-day MA remains above the 100-day MA, continuing an upward ascent which is also mirrored in the 100 and 200-day MA.As BTC descends, $8,400 is the nearest support, and recall that last week’s 50-day MA near ($8,500) was the breakout point BTC needed to cross in order to open up the rally towards $10,000.BTC could drop to the current 50-day MA but at this point, bulls have put up a fight around $8,800 and a drop to $8,600 probably won’t hold for long.At the time of writing the 5-day EMA and 10-Day MA continue to trend south, as does the Stoch which indicate further decline could be in store but it should be noted that BTC has rebounded from $8,785 to $9,045 so a return to today’s high and even $10,000 could occur when the Stoch and RSI show signs of reversal.VisionThe long term setup for BTC remains positive and continued growth towards $10,000 is likely.$8,600 – $8,800 remain a contested zone with $8,400 serving as the most immediate support.A dip and close below $8,500 is concerning but not catastrophic as BTC continues to trade above the descending channel.This is a healthy correction after a nearly 35% gain since March 3rd. As the Stoch and MACD reverse  the rally should recommence and BTC may touch new highs above $10,000.Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are not intended as investment advice.
