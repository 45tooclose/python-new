      BREAKING DOWN 'International Petroleum Exchange'
      The International Petroleum Exchange was founded in 1980 by a group of energy and futures traders. The petroleum industry suffered from unprecedented volatility in the 1970s, which originated from political and military conflicts in the Middle East. The disruption in the global petroleum markets sent U.S. gasoline prices soaring and its effects spread to other corners of global economy.
Futures contracts on underlying petroleum supplies allowed producers and consumers to hedge their positions and protect themselves against future volatility. A futures contract is a legal agreement between two parties to exchange an agreed-upon asset for an agreed-upon price at a date in the future. The future seller of the asset has a short contract, while the future buyer is said to be long. Futures contracts are quoted in U.S. dollars and cents and are expressed in lots of 1000 barrels. A consumer of unrefined crude oil who is worried about a future spike in crude prices might buy a long contract to purchase crude at a lower price. Any such contract must include a counterparty whose short position exposes them to significant risk if they need to go to the market to purchase oil to deliver to the long contract holder.
In addition to the oil producers and consumers active in futures markets for hedging purposes, speculators have joined the markets in search of profits from movements in oil prices. Rather than seeking to protect themselves from the uncertainty of future prices, these traders seek to capitalize on their predictions of price movements. While these individual trades have on impact on underlying commodity prices, large numbers of speculative trades can lead to price movements. Many researchers believe that oil speculation contributed to the sharp rise in oil and gas prices in 2006.
IPE become known as ICE Futures after its purchase by the Intercontinental Exchange in 2001.  It has expanded its portfolio of futures offerings to include various energy products, including natural gas and electricity. In 2005, the exchange moved from an open outcry system, where floor trader execute orders with a system of hand signals, to an electronic trading system. Major competitors are the New York Mercantile Exchange, or NYMEX, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
