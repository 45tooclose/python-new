Wrote the creator:The doors are open and I am so happy to finally have a finished site for the Monero community. It’s been a long 7 months of work but it is definitely a labor of love. I have been using www.MyMonero.com for over a year (thank you /fluffyponyza for the amazing service) and thought I could improve some aspects of the program and build out a bunch of cool new features. Having another Monero web wallet also helps with decentralization in case MyMonero is inaccessible.As noted in Nath’s post, the new wallet boasts a slew of improved and interesting featured, including:Full client-side operationFast transactionsInstant account creationSupport for ten languagesCompatibility with MyMonero seeds for wallet importsCompatibility with original Monero seeds for wallet importsNo transaction import requirementVisible height synchronization with a progress barAn automatically-updated XMR/USD balance viewMax function on send pageMultiple seed access (in new tab)No registration requirementsNo logsAdditional features are also currently in development, including seamless access to coins on forked chains — such as Monero Classic (XMC), Monero Original (XMO), and MoneroV (XMV) — and a Twitter account for live updates.Nath (short for Nathalie) also notes that she’s is incredibly busy, so any assistance, feedback, and support from the community would be appreciated. She writes:I currently have a full-time job so I will spend any extra hours I have improving xmrwallet, if you notice any bugs please let me know so I can squish them promptly. My direct email is [email protected] If you wish to support the site you can click on support to find my xmr wallet address.XMRWALLET has already received plenty of positive feedback from the community. notgiven688 commented that the new wallet “looks great — and with great I mean really really great,” while other users commented on the design, support for 10 languages, and the ability to send a maximum amount. In regards to the latter, user qwertycian wrote:It’s great that there’s an option to send the max amount. This is a problem with MyMonero that people often complain about [on the subreddit]: not being able to sweep their entire wallet.To check out the new XMRWALLET for yourself, head on over to www.xmrwallet.com — where you can easily and quickly create an account and get started.What do you think the new XMRWALLET?
