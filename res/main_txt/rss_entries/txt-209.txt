Blackmoon Crypto is a Fintech blockchain-based company that raised $30 million during its ICO in September last year.  
The company lets its users create, promote, develop and manage investment funds while covering all aspects of technology and infrastructure from legal compliance to corporate structuring. 
Its founder Oleg Seydak was previously co-founder of Flint Capital, a VC company that pioneered alternative lending in Europe.  
From June 2015 to July 2017, Blackmoon processed more than $100 million in deals volume and started operations in 9 countries. 
Monty Munford: Blackmoon wants to bring the traditional (fiat) and crypto universe in the investment industry together. Why is this necessary?  
Oleg Seydak: For any innovation in history, it takes time for it to be understood and integrated into the mainstream acceptance. The initial period of uncertainty and volatility creates potential downside for the investors, as was the case with the dot com bubble.

We are using technological innovations found in decentralized ledger technology (DLT) and smart contracts to tokenize financial investments. The pricing volatility we see today is not related to the innovations we are bringing to the industry. 
 
We are simply providing a better, cheaper, faster technology model, disintermediating many of the extraneous costs that are accepted, commonplace and priced-in. 
Is blockchain the only solution for decentralization? Or are there other options? 
There are many competing solutions that can provide decentralized transactional authority and a trusted counter party for value transfer.  However, DLT is most effective when used by a consortium of like-minded members. The digital universe may have to choose between two different types of a decentralized economy model.
