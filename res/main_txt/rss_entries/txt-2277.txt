It used the OP_Return feature of the bitcoin protocol, that allows inserting any message regarding the transaction, to pass the characters. However, the transactions were invalid and no exchange of Bitcoin happened. Due to the very nature of the blockchain, the flag containing TD Ameritrade’s will be there permanently on Bitcoin’s ledger.TD Ameritrade on Bitcoin ledgerIn the official announcement, the company noted: “We love finding new ways to use emerging technology. So we decided to have a little fun and plant our flag. Okay – technically, we embedded it”“With a part of the blockchain called OP_Return, which functions like the memo space on a check, simple messages and characters can be placed within transactions on the blockchain. By linking 68 individual transactions, with 80 characters per transaction, we were able to create the larger image,” it added.Though the feature of OP_Return was introduced in 2013, the developers do not endorse storing any arbitrary data on the blockchain as it consumes space permanently.What is TD Ameritrade?TD Ameritrade is a subsidiary of TD ‎Ameritrade Holding Corporation which provides online investing options to its retail and institutional clients.
