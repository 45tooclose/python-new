NBA superstar Stephen Curry has inked a deal that will see him become the first celebrity to get the CryptoKitty treatment.
The partnership, which was struck through Moji — Curry’s emoji app development company — will see the Golden State Warriors point guard release a series of three exclusive CryptoKitties modeled after his likeness.
“Stephen is the perfect partner to try out this new kind of Kitty,” said Mack Flavelle, co-founder of CryptoKitties. “He’s an incredible athlete, but also has a deep interest in technology and innovation.”
The first “CurryKitty” — named “Steph Fur Three” — went up for auction on Monday, and the final purchase price could rival the six-figure sales seen in mid-December at the height of CryptoKittiy mania.

This particular cat’s biography focuses on Curry’s athletic achievements, while another — “Chef Furry” — focuses on his budding culinary process.
“Hi! I’m Chef Furry! You might know me as a two-time MVP on the court, but I’m also runner up for MVP in the kitchen (I share the kitchen with my partner and she keeps me humble),” his biography reads. “Can you guess what my favourite dish is? If you said curry, paws for a second and ask yourself if I’ve heard that one before. If you said my lady’s chicken parm, get out of my head!”
CryptoKitties allows users to buy, sell, and breed digital cats, and it runs on the Ethereum blockchain as a decentralized application (DApp). Cats are structured as ERC-721 tokens, which are non-fungible and built to represent unique assets.
The game — which was originally created by Canada-based development studio Axiom Zen — recently spun off into its own venture after raising $12 million in a Series A funding round.
Though lauded for their potential, this promise has yet to translate into widespread real-world usage. According to Dapp Radar, just one DApp has more than 1,000 daily active users, and fewer than 20 DApps have more than 100 daily active users.
